            ".  emma by jane austen 1816 volumechapteremma woodhouse handsome clever and rich withcomfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her  . she was the youngest of the two daughters ofmost affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sistermarriage been mistress of his house fromvery early period  . her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short ofmother in affection  . sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr  . woodhousefamily less asgoverness thanfriend very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma  . between them it was more the intimacy of sisters  . even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming miss taylorjudgment but directed chiefly by her own  . the real evils indeed of emmasituation were the power of having rather too much her own way anddisposition to thinklittle too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments  . the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her  . sorrow came --gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness  .-- miss taylor married  . it was miss taylorloss which first brought grief  . it was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance  . the wedding over and the bride - people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect ofthird to cheerlong evening  . her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost  . the event had every promise of happiness for her friend  . mr  . weston wasman of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it wasblack morningwork for her  . the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day  . she recalled her past kindness -- the kindness the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood  .large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabellamarriage on their being left to each other was yetdearer tenderer recollection  . she had beenfriend and companion such as few possessed intelligent well - informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault  . how was she to bear the change -- it was true that her friend was going only halfmile from them but emma was aware that great must be the difference betweenmrs  . weston only halfmile from them andmiss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude  . she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her  . he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful  . the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr  . woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having beenvaletudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he wasmuch older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time  . her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and manylong october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again  . highbury the large and populous village almost amounting totown to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals  . the woodhouses were first in consequence there  . all looked up to them  . she had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even halfday  . it wasmelancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful  . his spirits required support  . he wasnervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind  . matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughtermarrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirelymatch of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sadthing for herself as for them and would have beengreat deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield  . emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor miss taylor --wish she were here again  . whatpity it is that mr  . weston ever thought of hercannot agree with you papa you knowcannot  . mr  . weston is suchgood - humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deservesgood wife -- and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might havehouse of her ownhouse of her own -- but where is the advantage ofhouse of her own this is three times as large  .-- and you have never any odd humours my dear  . how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us -- we shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon  . my dear how amto get so far randalls is suchdistance  .could not walk half so far  . no papa nobody thought of your walking  . we must go in the carriage to be sure  . the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for suchlittle way -- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit they are to be put into mr  . westonstable papa  . you know we have settled all that already  . we talked it all over with mr  . weston last night  . and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughterbeing housemaid there  .only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else  . that was your doing papa  . you got hannah that good place  . nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her -- james is so obliged to youam very gladdid think of her  . it was very lucky forwould not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account andam sure she will makevery good servant she iscivil pretty - spoken girlhavegreat opinion of her  . wheneversee her she always curtseys and asks me howdo invery pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needleworkobserve she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it  .am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will begreat comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see  . whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us  . he will be able to tell her how we all are  . emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own  . the backgammon - table was placed butvisitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary  . mr  . knightleysensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty was not onlyvery old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabellahusband  . he lived aboutmile from highbury wasfrequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london  . he had returned tolate dinner after some days absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square  . it washappy circumstance and animated mr  . woodhouse for some time  . mr  . knightley hadcheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily  . when this was over mr  . woodhouse gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr  . knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us  .am afraid you must have hadshocking walk  . not at all sir  . it isbeautiful moonlight night and so mild thatmust draw back from your great fire  . but you must have found it very damp and dirty  .wish you may not catch cold  . dirty sir look at my shoes  . notspeck on them  . well that is quite surprising for we have hadvast deal of rain here  . it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast  .wanted them to put off the wedding  . by the bye --have not wished you joy  . being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feelinghave been in no hurry with my congratulations buthope it all went off tolerably well  . how did you all behave who cried most ah poor miss taylor tissad business  . poor mr  . and miss woodhouse if you please butcannot possibly say poor miss taylor  .havegreat regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence -- at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two  . especially when one of those two is suchfanciful troublesome creature said emma playfully  . that is what you have in your headknow -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by  .believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr  . woodhouse withsigh  .am afraidam sometimes very fanciful and troublesome  . my dearest papa you do not thinkcould mean you or suppose mr  . knightley to mean you  . whathorrible idea oh nomeant only myself  . mr  . knightley loves to find fault with me you know -- injoke -- it is alljoke  . we always say what we like to one another  . mr  . knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect suchcircumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body  . emma knowsnever flatter her said mr  . knightley butmeant no reflection on any body  . miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one  . the chances are that she must begainer  . well said emma willing to let it pass -- you want to hear about the wedding andshall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly  . every body was punctual every body in their best looks nottear and hardlylong face to be seen  . oh no we all felt that we were going to be only halfmile apart and were sure of meeting every day  . dear emma bears every thing so well said her father  . but mr  . knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor andam sure she will miss her more than she thinks for  . emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles  . it is impossible that emma should not miss suchcompanion said mr  . knightley  . we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss tayloradvantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylortime of life to be settled inhome of her own and how important to her to be secure ofcomfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure  . every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married  . and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma andvery considerable one -- thatmade the match myself  .made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr  . weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing  . mr  . knightley shook his head at her  . her father fondly replied ah my dearwish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass  . pray do not make any more matches  .promise you to make none for myself papa butmust indeed for other people  . it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know -- every body said that mr  . weston would never marry again  . oh dear no mr  . weston who had beenwidower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable withoutwife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful -- mr  . weston need not spendsingle evening in the year alone if he did not like it  . oh no mr  . weston certainly would never marry again  . some people even talked ofpromise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him  . all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject butbelieved none of it  . ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that miss taylor andmet with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchelli made up my mind on the subject  .planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think thatshall leave off match - making  .do not understand what you mean by success said mr  . knightley  . success supposes endeavour  . your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage  .worthy employment foryoung ladymind but if whichrather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle daythink it would bevery good thing for miss taylor if mr  . weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you madelucky guess and that is all that can be said  . and have you never known the pleasure and triumph oflucky guess --pity you  .--thought you cleverer -- for depend upon itlucky guess is never merely luck  . there is always some talent in it  . and as to my poor word success which you quarrel withdo not know thatam so entirely without any claim to it  . you have drawn two pretty pictures butthink there may bethird --something between the do - nothing and the do - all  . ifhad not promoted mr  . westonvisits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all  .think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that  .straightforward open - hearted man like weston andrational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns  . you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference  . emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined mr  . woodhouse understanding but in part  . but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up onefamily circle grievously  . only one more papa only for mr  . elton  . poor mr  . elton you like mr  . elton papa --must look about forwife for him  . there is nobody in highbury who deserves him -- and he has been herewhole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would beshame to have him single any longer -- andthought when he was joining their hands to - day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for himthink very well of mr  . elton and this is the only wayhave of doing himservice  . mr  . elton isvery pretty young man to be sure andvery good young man andhavegreat regard for him  . but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day  . that will bemuch better thing  .dare say mr  . knightley will be so kind as to meet him  . withgreat deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr  . knightley laughing andagree with you entirely that it will bemuch better thing  . invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife  . depend upon itman of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself  . chapter ii mr  . weston wasnative of highbury and born ofrespectable family which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property  . he had receivedgood education but on succeeding early in life tosmall independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied  . captain weston wasgeneral favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill ofgreat yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend  . miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the infinite mortification of mr  . and mrs  . churchill who threw her off with due decorum  . it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness  . mrs  . weston ought to have found more in it for she hadhusband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best  . she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brotherunreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home  . they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe  . captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died afterthree years marriage he was ratherpoorer man than at first and withchild to maintain  . from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved  . the boy had with the additional softening claim oflingering illness of his motherbeen the means ofsort of reconciliation and mr  . and mrs  . churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease  . some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could  .complete change of life became desirable  . he quitted the militia and engaged in trade having brothers already established ingood way in london which afforded himfavourable opening  . it wasconcern which brought just employment enough  . he had stillsmall house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away  . he had by that time realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase oflittle estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed for -- enough to marrywoman as portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition  . it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished  . he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginningnew period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through  . he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightfulwell - judging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its beinggreat deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it  . he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncleheir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age  . it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his fatherassistance  . his father had no apprehension of it  . the aunt wascapricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in mr  . westonnature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear  . he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him and his fond report of him asvery fine young man had made highbury feelsort of pride in him too  . he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospectskind of common concern  . mr  . frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury andlively curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life  . his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved  . now upon his fathermarriage it was very generally proposed asmost proper attention that the visit should take place  . there was notdissentient voice on the subject either when mrs  . perry drank tea with mrs  . and miss bates or when mrs  . and miss bates returned the visit  . now was the time for mr  . frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion  . forfew days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs  . weston had received  .suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr  . frank churchill has written to mrs  . westonunderstand it wasvery handsome letter indeed  . mr  . woodhouse told me of it  . mr  . woodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw suchhandsome letter in his life  . it was indeedhighly prized letter  . mrs  . weston had of course formedvery favourable idea of the young man and suchpleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense andmost welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured  . she felt herselfmost fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only regret was forpartial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her  . she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of emmalosingsingle pleasure or suffering an hourennui from the want of her companionableness but dear emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations  . and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr  . westondisposition and circumstances which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together  . her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs  . weston and of moments only of regret and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity poor miss taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband tocarriage of her own  . but never did she go without mr  . woodhousegivinggentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay  . there was no recovering miss taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her butfew weeks brought some alleviation to mr  . woodhouse  . the compliments of his neighbours were over he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event and the wedding - cake which had beengreat distress to him was all eat up  . his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be different from himself  . what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any bodyeating it  . he had been at the pains of consulting mr  . perry the apothecary on the subject  . mr  . perry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr  . woodhouselife and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people unless taken moderately  . with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr  . woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone  . there wasstrange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen withslice of mrs  . westonwedding - cake in their hands but mr  . woodhouse would never believe it  . chapter iii mr  . woodhouse was fond of society in his own way  . he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle ingreat measure as he liked  . he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner - parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms  . fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr  . knightley comprehended many such  . not unfrequently through emmapersuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make upcard - table for him  . real long - standing regard brought the westons and mr  . knightley and by mr  . eltonyoung man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr  . woodhousedrawing - room and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away  . after these camesecond set among the most come - at - able of whom were mrs  . and miss bates and mrs  . goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr  . woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses  . had it taken place only onceyear it would have beengrievance  . mrs  . bates the widow offormer vicar of highbury wasvery old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille  . she lived with her single daughter invery small way and was considered with all the regard and respect whichharmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite  . her daughter enjoyedmost uncommon degree of popularity forwoman neither young handsome rich nor married  . miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect  . she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness  . her youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care offailing mother and the endeavour to makesmall income go as far as possible  . and yet she washappy woman andwoman whom no one named without good - will  . it was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders  . she loved every body was interested in every bodyhappiness quicksighted to every bodymerits thought herselfmost fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends andhome that wanted for nothing  . the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit wererecommendation to every body andmine of felicity to herself  . she wasgreat talker upon little matters which exactly suited mr  . woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip  . mrs  . goddard was the mistress ofschool -- not ofseminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- butreal honest old - fashioned boarding - school wherereasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold atreasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves intolittle education without any danger of coming back prodigies  . mrs  . goddardschool was in high repute -- and very deservedly for highbury was reckonedparticularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run aboutgreat deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands  . it was no wonder thattrain of twenty young couple now walked after her to church  . she wasplain motherly kind of woman who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday oftea - visit and having formerly owed much to mr  . woodhousekindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancy - work whenever she could and win or losefew sixpences by his fireside  . these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her fathersake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of mrs  . weston  . she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated  . as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly suchclose of the present daynote was brought from mrs  . goddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with hermost welcome request for miss smith wasgirl of seventeen whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty  .very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion  . harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody  . somebody had placed her several years back at mrs  . goddardschool and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder  . this was all that was generally known of her history  . she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and was now just returned fromlong visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her  . she wasvery pretty girl and her beauty happened to be ofsort which emma particularly admired  . she was short plump and fair withfine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features andlook of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance  . she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smithconversation but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becomingdeference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superiorstyle to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement  . encouragement should be given  . those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions  . the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her  . the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort of people must be doing her harm  . they werefamily of the name of martin whom emma well knew by character as rentinglarge farm of mr  . knightley and residing in the parish of donwell -- very creditably she believed -- she knew mr  . knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates ofgirl who wanted onlylittle more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect  . she would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners  . it would be an interesting and certainlyvery kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers  . she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens that the evening flew away atvery unusual rate and the supper - table which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware  . with an alacrity beyond the common impulse ofspirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real good - will ofmind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests  . upon such occasions poor mr  . woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare  . he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat  . such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self - approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say mrs  . bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs  . an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome  . serle understands boiling an egg better than any body  .would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you  . miss bates let emma help you tolittle bit of tart --very little bit  . ours are all apple - tarts  . you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here  .do not advise the custard  . mrs  . goddard what say you to halfglass of winesmall half - glass put intotumbler of waterdo not think it could disagree with you  . emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors inmuch more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy  . the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions  . miss woodhouse was so greatpersonage in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last chapter iv harriet smithintimacy at hartfield was soonsettled thing  . quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other  . aswalking companion emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her  . in that respect mrs  . westonloss had been important  . her father never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied and since mrs  . westonmarriage her exercise had been too much confined  . she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant andharriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any time towalk would bevaluable addition to her privileges  . but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs  . harriet certainly was not clever but she hadsweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to  . her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected  . altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smithbeing exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required  . suchfriend as mrs  . weston was out of the question  . two such could never be granted  . two such she did not want  . it was quitedifferent sort of thingsentiment distinct and independent  . mrs  . weston was the object ofregard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem  . harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful  . for mrs  . weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing  . her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents but harriet could not tell  . she was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain  . emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth  . harriet had no penetration  . she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs  . goddard chose to tell her and looked no farther  . mrs  . goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturallygreat part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey - mill farm it must have been the whole  . but the martins occupied her thoughtsgood deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place  . emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by suchpicture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs  . martinhaving two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs  . goddarddrawing - room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and onelittle welch cowvery pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs  . martinsaying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their havingvery handsome summer - house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea --very handsome summer - house large enough to holddozen people  . for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose  . she had taken upwrong idea fancying it wasmother and daughterson and sonwife who all lived together but when it appeared that the mr  . martin who borepart in the narrative and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other wassingle man that there was no young mrs  . martin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever  . with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr  . martin and there was evidently no dislike to it  . harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dweltgood deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging  . he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in every thing else he was so very obliging  . he had his shepherdson into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her  . she was very fond of singing  . he could singlittle himself  . she believed he was very clever and understood every thing  . he hadvery fine flock and while she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country  . she believed every body spoke well of him  . his mother and sisters were very fond of him  . mrs  . martin had told her one day and there wasblush as she said it that it was impossible for any body to bebetter son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he would makegood husband  . not that she wanted him to marry  . she was in no hurry at all  . well done mrs  . martin thought emma  . you know what you are about  . and when she had come away mrs  . martin was so very kind as to send mrs  . goddardbeautiful goose -- the finest goose mrs  . goddard had ever seen  . mrs  . goddard had dressed it onsunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her  . mr  . martinsuppose is notman of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read oh yes -- that is no --do not know -- butbelieve he has readgood deal -- but not what you would think any thing of  . he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all them to himself  . but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining  . andknow he has read the vicar of wakefield  . he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey  . he had never heard of such books beforementioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can  . the next question was -- what sort of looking man is mr  . martin oh not handsome -- not at all handsome  .thought him very plain at first butdo not think him so plain now  . one does not you know aftertime  . but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston  . he has passed you very often  . that may be andmay have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name  .young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity  . the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whomfeelcan have nothing to do  .degree or two lower andcreditable appearance might interest memight hope to be useful to their families in some way or other  . butfarmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it  . to be sure  . oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed --mean by sight  .have no doubt of his beingvery respectable young man  .know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well  . what do you imagine his age to be he was four - and - twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd justfortnight anddaydifference -- which is very odd  . only four - and - twenty  . that is too young to settle  . his mother is perfectly right not to be inhurry  . they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it  . six years hence if he could meet withgood sort of young woman in the same rank as his own withlittle money it might be very desirable  . six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence  . mr  . martinimagine has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world  . whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it isdare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet  . to be sure so it is  . but they live very comfortably  . they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs  . martin talks of takingboy another year  .wish you may not get intoscrape harriet whenever he does marry --mean as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters fromsuperior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice  . the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates  . there can be no doubt of your beinggentlemandaughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you  . yes to be suresuppose there are  . but whilevisit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouseam not afraid of what any body can do  . you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet butwould have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse  .want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and thereforesay that if you should still be in this country when mr  . martin marrieswish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmerdaughter without education  . to be sure  . yes  . not thatthink mr  . martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up  . howeverdo not mean to set up my opinion against your-- andam sureshall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife  .shall always havegreat regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me  . but if he marriesvery ignorant vulgar woman certainlyhad better not visit her ifcan help it  . emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love  . the young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on harrietside to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own  . they met mr  . martin the very next day as they were walking on the donwell road  . he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion  . emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walkingfew yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr  . robert martin  . his appearance was very neat and he looked likesensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harrietinclination  . harriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her fathergentleness with admiration as well as wonder  . mr  . martin looked as if he did not know what manner was  . they remained butfew minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her withsmiling face and influtter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose  . only think of our happening to meet him -- how very odd it was quitechance he said that he had not gone round by randalls  . he did not think we ever walked this road  . he thought we walked towards randalls most days  . he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet  . he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to - morrow  . so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain he is very plain undoubtedly -- remarkably plain -- but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility  .had no right to expect much anddid not expect much buthad no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air  .had imagined himconfessdegree or two nearer gentility  . to be sure said harriet inmortified voice he is not so genteel as real gentlemen  .think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr  . martin  . at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men  .should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr  . martin again without perceiving him to bevery inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before  . do not you begin to feel that now were not you struckam sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness ofvoice whichheard to be wholly unmodulated asstood here  . certainly he is not like mr  . knightley  . he has not suchfine air and way of walking as mr  . knightley  .see the difference plain enough  . but mr  . knightley is so very fineman mr  . knightleyair is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr  . martin with him  . you might not see one inhundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr  . knightley  . but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to  . what say you to mr  . weston and mr  . elton compare mr  . martin with either of them  . compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent  . you must see the difference  . oh yes -- there isgreat difference  . but mr  . weston is almost an old man  . mr  . weston must be between forty and fifty  . which makes his good manners the more valuable  . the olderperson grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes  . what is passable in youth is detestable in later age  . mr  . martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr  . westontime of life there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly  . but there may be pretty good guessing  . he will becompletely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss  . will he indeed that will be very bad  . how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended  . he wasgreat deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be forthriving man  . what has he to do with books andhave no doubt that he will thrive and bevery rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us  .wonder he did not remember the book -- was all harrietanswer and spoken withdegree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself  . she therefore said no more for some time  . her next beginning was in one respect perhaps mr  . eltonmanners are superior to mr  . knightleyor mr  . weston . they have more gentleness  . they might be more safely held up aspattern  . there is an opennessquickness almostbluntness in mr  . weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied  . neither would mr  . knightleydownright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable  . on the contrarythinkyoung man might be very safely recommended to take mr  . elton asmodel  . mr  . elton is good - humoured cheerful obliging and gentle  . he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late  .do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be  . if he means any thing it must be to please you  . did nottell you what he said of you the other day she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from mr  . elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed and smiled and said she had always thought mr  . elton very agreeable  . mr  . elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriethead  . she thought it would be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her to have much merit in planning it  . she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict  . it was not likely however that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harrietcoming to hartfield  . the longer she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency  . mr  . eltonsituation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connexions at the same time not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet  . he hadcomfortable home for her and emma imaginedvery sufficient income for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him asgood - humoured well - meaning respectable young man without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world  . she had already satisfied herself that he thought harrietbeautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on harrietthere could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy  . and he was reallyvery pleasing young manyoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like  . he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her there beingwant of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with -- but the girl who could be gratified byrobert martinriding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr  . eltonadmiration  . chapteri do not know what your opinion may be mrs  . weston said mr  . knightley of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith butthink itbad thing  .bad thing do you really think itbad thing -- why sothink they will neither of them do the other any good  . you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her withnew object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good  .have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure  . how very differently we feel -- not think they will do each other any good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr  . knightley  . perhaps you thinkam come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle  . mr  . weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly asdo on the subject  . we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be suchgirl in highbury for her to associate with  . mr  . knightleyshall not allow you to befair judge in this case  . you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value ofcompanion and perhaps no man can begood judge of the comfortwoman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life  .can imagine your objection to harriet smith  . she is not the superior young woman which emmafriend ought to be  . but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself  . they will read together  . she means itknow  . emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old  .have seengreat many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule  . the list she drew up when only fourteen --remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit thatpreserved it some time anddare say she may have made outvery good list now  . buthave done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma  . she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience andsubjection of the fancy to the understanding  . where miss taylor failed to stimulatemay safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing  .-- you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished  .-- you know you could not  .dare say replied mrs  . weston smiling thatthought so then -- but since we have partedcan never remember emmaomitting to do any thingwished  . there is hardly any desiring to refresh suchmemory as that -- said mr  . knightley feelingly and formoment or two he had done  . buthe soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember  . emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family  . at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen  . she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident  . and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all  . in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her  . she inherits her mothertalents and must have been under subjection to her  .should have been sorry mr  . knightley to be dependent on your recommendation hadquitted mr  . woodhousefamily and wanted another situationdo not think you would have spokengood word for me to any body  .am sure you always thought me unfit for the officeheld  . yes said he smiling  . you are better placed here very fit forwife but not at all forgoverness  . but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield  . you might not give emma suchcomplete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receivingvery good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend himwifeshould certainly have named miss taylor  . thank you  . there will be very little merit in makinggood wife to suchman as mr  . weston  . why to own the trutham afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne  . we will not despair however  . weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him  .hope not that  .-- it is not likely  . no mr  . knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter  . notindeed  .only name possibilities  .do not pretend to emmagenius for foretelling and guessing  .hope with all my heart the young man may beweston in merit andchurchill in fortune  .-- but harriet smith --have not half done about harriet smith  .think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have  . she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing  . she isflatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned  . her ignorance is hourly flattery  . how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting suchdelightful inferiority and as for harrietwill venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance  . hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to  . she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home  .am much mistaken if emmadoctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to makegirl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life  .-- they only givelittle polish  .either depend more upon emmagood sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort forcannot lament the acquaintance  . how well she looked last night oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you very wellshall not attempt to deny emmabeing pretty  . pretty say beautiful rather  . can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether -- face and figuredo not know whatcould imagine butconfess thathave seldom seenface or figure more pleasing to me than hers  . butampartial old friend  . such an eye -- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant regular features open countenance withcomplexion oh whatbloom of full health and suchpretty height and size suchfirm and upright figure there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance  . one hears sometimes ofchild being the picture of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health  . she is loveliness itself  . mr  . knightley is not shehave notfault to find with her person he replied  .think her all you describe  .love to look at her andwill add this praise thatdo not think her personally vain  . considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way  . mrs  . westonam not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm  . andmr  . knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm  . with all dear emmalittle faults she is an excellent creature  . where shall we seebetter daughter orkinder sister ortruer friend no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the righthundred times  . very wellwill not plague you any more  . emma shall be an angel andwill keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella  . john loves emma withreasonable and therefore notblind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children  .am sure of having their opinions with me  .know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr  . knightley iftake the libertyconsider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emmamother might have had the liberty of hinting thatdo not think any possible good can arise from harriet smithintimacy being madematter of much discussion among you  . pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it issource of pleasure to herself  . it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr  . knightley at this little remains of office  . not at all cried heam much obliged to you for it  . it is very good advice and it shall havebetter fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to  . mrs  . john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister  . be satisfied said hewill not raise any outcry  .will keep my ill - humour to myself  .havevery sincere interest in emma  . isabella does not seem more my sister has never excitedgreater interest perhaps hardly so great  . there is an anxietycuriosity in what one feels for emma  .wonder what will become of her so dosaid mrs  . weston gently very much  . she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all  . buthave no idea that she has yet ever seenman she cared for  . it would not bebad thing for her to be very much in love withproper object  .should like to see emma in love and in some doubt ofreturn it would do her good  . but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home  . there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present said mrs  . weston as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfieldcannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr  . woodhouseaccount  .do not recommend matrimony at present to emma thoughmean no slight to the stateassure you  . part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr  . westonon the subject as much as possible  . there were wishes at randalls respecting emmadestiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which mr  . knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield  . chapter vi emma could not feeldoubt of having given harrietfancyproper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity tovery good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr  . eltonbeingremarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harrietside as there could be any occasion for  . she was quite convinced of mr  . eltonbeing in the fairest way of falling in love if not in love already  . she had no scruple with regard to him  . he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could not suppose any thing wanting whichlittle time would not add  . his perception of the striking improvement of harrietmanner since her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment  . you have given miss smith all that she required said he you have made her graceful and easy  . she wasbeautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature  .am glad you thinkhave been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receivingfew very few hints  . she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself  .have done very little  . if it were admissible to contradictlady said the gallant mr  . elton --have perhaps given herlittle more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before  . exactly so that is what principally strikes me  . so much superadded decision of character skilful has been the hand great has been the pleasuream sure  .never met withdisposition more truly amiable  .have no doubt of it  . and it was spoken withsort of sighing animation which hadvast deal of the lover  . she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he secondedsudden wish of hers to have harrietpicture  . did you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did you ever sit for your picture harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say withvery interesting naivete oh dear no never  . no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed what an exquisite possessiongood picture of her would bewould give any money for it  .almost long to attempt her likeness myself  . you do not know itdare say but two or three years agohadgreat passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to havetolerable eye in general  . but from one cause or anothergave it up in disgust  . but reallycould almost venture if harriet would sit to me  . it would be suchdelight to have her picture let me entreat you cried mr  . elton it would indeed bedelight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charmingtalent in favour of your friend  .know what your drawings are  . how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs  . weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room at randalls yes good man -- thought emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses you know nothing of drawing  . donpretend to be in raptures about mine  . keep your raptures for harrietface  . well if you give me such kind encouragement mr  . eltonbelieveshall try whatcan do  . harrietfeatures are very delicate which makeslikeness difficult and yet there ispeculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch  . exactly so -- the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth --have notdoubt of your success  . pray pray attempt it  . as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession  . butam afraid mr  . elton harriet will not like to sit  . she thinks so little of her own beauty  . did not you observe her manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn oh yesobserved itassure you  . it was not lost on me  . but stillcannot imagine she would not be persuaded  . harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others  . emma wished to go to work directly and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they might decide together on the best size for harriet  . her many beginnings were displayed  . miniatures half - lengths whole - lengths pencil crayon and water - colours had been all tried in turn  . she had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to  . she played and sang -- and drew in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of  . she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist ormusician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved  . there was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished perhaps the most her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same  . they were both in ecstasies  .likeness pleases every body and miss woodhouseperformances must be capital  . no great variety of faces for you said emma  .had only my own family to study from  . there is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous thatcould only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore  . mrs  . weston again and again and again you see  . dear mrs  . weston always my kindest friend on every occasion  . she would sit wheneverasked her  . there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure -- and the face not unlike  .should have madegood likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in suchhurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet  . then here come all my attempts at three of those four children -- there they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest  . she was so eager to have them drawn thatcould not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mamachildren ever were  . here is my sketch of the fourth who wasbaby  .took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as stronglikeness of his cockade as you would wish to see  . he had nestled down his head most conveniently  . thatvery like  .am rather proud of little george  . the corner of the sofa is very good  . then here is my last -- unclosingpretty sketch ofgentleman in small size whole - length -- my last and my best -- my brother mr  . john knightley  .-- this did not want much of being finished whenput it away inpet and vowedwould never take another likeness  .could not help being provoked for after all my pains and whenhad really madevery good likeness of it -- mrs  . weston andwere quite agreed in thinking it very like -- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that wasfault on the right side -- after all this came poor dear isabellacold approbation of -- yes it waslittle like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice  . we had hadgreat deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all  . it was madegreat favour of and altogether it was more thancould bear and sonever would finish it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick square -- and assaiddid then forswear ever drawing any body again  . but for harrietsake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at presentwill break my resolution now  . mr  . elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe  . exactly so  . no husbands and wives with so interestingconsciousness that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once  . but as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must waitlittle longer  . she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait  . it was to bewhole - length in water - colours like mr  . john knightleyand was destined if she could please herself to holdvery honourable station over the mantelpiece  . the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presentedvery sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist  . but there was no doing any thing with mr  . elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch  . she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to place himself elsewhere  . it then occurred to her to employ him in reading  . if he would be so good as to read to them it would bekindness indeed it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the irksomeness of miss smith . mr  . elton was only too happy  . harriet listened and emma drew in peace  . she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look any thing less would certainly have been too little inlover and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmed  .-- there was no being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration made him discernlikeness almost before it was possible  . she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable  . the sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first daysketch to wish to go on  . there was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant to throw inlittle improvement to the figure to givelittle more height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of its being in every waypretty drawing at last and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both --standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations as mr  . eltonvery promising attachment was likely to add  . harriet was to sit again the next day and mr  . elton just as he ought entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again  . by all means  . we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party  . the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the picture which was rapid and happy  . every body who saw it was pleased but mr  . elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism  . miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted -- observed mrs  . weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressinglover  .-- the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes  . it is the fault of her face that she has them not  . do you think so replied he  .cannot agree with you  . it appears to memost perfect resemblance in every feature  .never saw suchlikeness in my life  . we must allow for the effect of shade you know  . you have made her too tall emma said mr  . knightley  . emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr  . elton warmly added oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall  . consider she is sitting down -- which naturally presentsdifferent -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved you know  . proportions fore - shortening  .-- oh no it gives one exactly the idea of suchheight as miss smith . exactly so indeed it is very pretty said mr  . woodhouse  . so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear  .do not know any body who draws so well as you do  . the only thingdo not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with onlylittle shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold  . but my dear papa it is supposed to be summerwarm day in summer  . look at the tree  . but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear  . you sir may say any thing cried mr  . elton butmust confess thatregard it asmost happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character  . the naivete of miss smithmanners -- and altogether -- oh it is most admirablecannot keep my eyes from it  .never saw suchlikeness  . the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here werefew difficulties  . it must be done directly it must be done in london the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions must not be applied to because it was december and mr  . woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december  . but no sooner was the distress known to mr  . elton than it was removed  . his gallantry was always on the alert  . might he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it he could ride to london at any time  . it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand  . he was too good -- she could not endure the thought -- she would not give him suchtroublesome office for the world -- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances -- andvery few minutes settled the business  . mr  . elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough  . whatprecious deposit said he withtender sigh as he received it  . this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma  .should say so but thatsuppose there may behundred different ways of being in love  . he is an excellent young man and will suit harriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more thancould endure asprincipal  .come in forpretty good share assecond  . but it is his gratitude on harrietaccount  . chapter vii the very day of mr  . eltongoing to london producedfresh occasion for emmaservices towards her friend  . harriet had been at hartfield as usual soon after breakfast and aftertime had gone home to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell  . halfminute brought it all out  . she had heard as soon as she got back to mrs  . goddardthat mr  . martin had been there an hour before and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had leftlittle parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copyletter to herself and this letter was from him from mr  . martin and containeddirect proposal of marriage  . who could have thought it she was so surprized she did not know what to do  . yes quiteproposal of marriage andvery good letter at least she thought so  . and he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do  .-- emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful  . upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking  . he will connect himself well if he can  . will you read the letter cried harriet  . pray do  .d rather you would  . emma was not sorry to be pressed  . she read and was surprized  . the style of the letter was much above her expectation  . there were not merely no grammatical errors but ascomposition it would not have disgracedgentleman the language though plain was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer  . it was short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling  . she paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion withwell well and was at last forced to add is itgood letter or is it too short yes indeedvery good letter replied emma rather slowly -- so goodletter harriet that every thing consideredthink one of his sisters must have helped him  .can hardly imagine the young man whomsaw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style ofwoman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough forwoman  . no doubt he issensible man andsuppose may havenatural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takespen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words  . it is so with some men  . yesunderstand the sort of mind  . vigorous decided with sentiments tocertain point not coarse  .better written letter harriet returning it thanhad expected  . well said the still waiting harriet -- well -- and -- and what shalldo what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard to this letter yes  . but what are you in doubt of you must answer it of course -- and speedily  . yes  . but what shallsay dear miss woodhouse do advise me  . oh no no the letter had much better be all your own  . you will express yourself very properlyam sure  . there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing  . your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to your mindam persuaded  . you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment  . you thinkought to refuse him then said harriet looking down  . ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to thatthought -- butbeg your pardon perhapshave been undermistake  .certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer  .had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it  . harriet was silent  . withlittle reserve of manner emma continued you mean to returnfavourable answercollect  . nodo not that isdo not mean -- what shalldo what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me whatought to do  .shall not give you any advice harriet  .will have nothing to do with it  . this ispoint which you must settle with your feelings  .had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet contemplating the letter  . forlittle while emma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to saylay it down asgeneral rule harriet that ifwoman doubts as to whether she should acceptman or not she certainly ought to refuse him  . if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly  . it is notstate to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with halfheart  .thought it my duty asfriend and older than yourself to say thus much to you  . but do not imagine thatwant to influence you  . oh noam sure you aregreat deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me whathad best do -- no nodo not mean that -- as you say onemind ought to be quite made up -- one should not be hesitating -- it isvery serious thing  .-- it will be safer to say no perhaps  .-- do you thinkhad better say no not for the world said emma smiling graciously wouldadvise you either way  . you must be the best judge of your own happiness  . if you prefer mr  . martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet  .-- does any body else occur to you at this moment under suchdefinition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion  . at this moment whom are you thinking of the symptoms were favourable  .-- instead of answering harriet turned away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard  . emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes  . at last with some hesitation harriet said -- miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinionmust do as well ascan by myself andhave now quite determined and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse mr  . martin  . do you thinkam right perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought  . while you were at all in suspensekept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decidedhave no hesitation in approving  . dear harrietgive myself joy of this  . it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr  . martin  . while you were in the smallest degree waveringsaid nothing about it becausewould not influence but it would have been the loss offriend to me  .could not have visited mrs  . robert martin of abbey - mill farm  . nowam secure of you for ever  . harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her forcibly  . you could not have visited me she cried looking aghast  . no to be sure you could not butnever thought of that before  . that would have been too dreadful -- what an escape -- dear miss woodhousewould not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world  . indeed harriet it would have beensevere pang to lose you but it must have been  . you would have thrown yourself out of all good society  .must have given you up  . dear me -- how shouldever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more dear affectionate creature -- you banished to abbey - mill farm -- you confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your lifewonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it  . he must havepretty good opinion of himself  .do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured andshall always feel much obliged to him and havegreat regard for -- but that is quitedifferent thing from -- and you know though he may like me it does not follow thatshould -- and certainlymust confess that since my visiting herehave seen people -- and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable  . howeverdo really think mr  . martinvery amiable young man and havegreat opinion of him and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing suchletter -- but as to leaving you it is whatwould not do upon any consideration  . thank you thank you my own sweet little friend  . we will not be parted  .woman is not to marryman merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can writetolerable letter  . oh no -- and it is butshort letter too  . emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass withvery true and it would besmall consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could writegood letter  . oh yes very  . nobody cares forletter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions  .am quite determined to refuse him  . but how shalldo what shallsay emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence  . the looking over his letter again in replying to it had suchsoftening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up withfew decisive expressions and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all  . this letter however was written and sealed and sent  . the business was finished and harriet safe  . she was rather low all the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr  . elton  .shall never be invited to abbey - mill again was said in rathersorrowful tone  . nor if you were couldever bear to part with you my harriet  . you aregreat deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey - mill  . andam sureshould never want to go there foram never happy but at hartfield  . some time afterwards it wasthink mrs  . goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened  .am sure miss nash would -- for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is onlylinen - draper  . one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher ofschool harriet  .dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married  . even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes  . as to any thing superior for yousuppose she is quite in the dark  . the attentions ofcertain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of highbury yet  . hithertofancy you andare the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves  . harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that people should like her so much  . the idea of mr  . elton was certainly cheering but still aftertime she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected mr  . martin  . now he has got my letter said she softly  .wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too  .hope he will not mind it so very much  . let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed cried emma  . at this moment perhaps mr  . elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name  . my picture -- but he has left my picture in bond - street  . has he so -- thenknow nothing of mr  . elton  . no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow  . it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight  . it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession  . how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger  . chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield that night  . for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to havebed - room appropriated to herself and emma judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible just at present  . she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs  . goddardbut it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield to makeregular visit of some days  . while she was gone mr  . knightley called and sat some time with mr  . woodhouse and emma till mr  . woodhouse who had previously made up his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his own civility to leave mr  . knightley for that purpose  . mr  . knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other  . wellbelieve if you will excuse me mr  . knightley if you will not consider me as doingvery rude thingshall take emmaadvice and go out forquarter of an hour  . as the sun is outbelievehad better take my three turns whilecan  .treat you without ceremony mr  . knightley  . we invalids think we are privileged people  . my dear sir do not makestranger of me  .leave an excellent substitute in my daughter  . emma will be happy to entertain you  . and thereforethinkwill beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk  . you cannot do better sir  .would ask for the pleasure of your company mr  . knightley butamvery slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey  . thank you sir thank youam going this moment myself andthink the sooner you go the better  .will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you  . mr  . woodhouse at last was off but mr  . knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat  . he began speaking of harriet and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before  .cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she ispretty little creature andam inclined to think very well of her disposition  . her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn outvaluable woman  .am glad you think so and the good handshope may not be wanting  . come said he you are anxious forcompliment sowill tell you that you have improved her  . you have cured her of her school - girlgiggle she really does you credit  . thank you  .should be mortified indeed ifdid not believehad been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may  . you do not often overpower me with it  . you are expecting her again you say this morning almost every moment  . she has been gone longer already than she intended  . something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps  . highbury gossips -- tiresome wretches harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would  . emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing  . he presently added withsmiledo not pretend to fix on times or places butmust tell you thathave good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage  . indeed how so of what sortvery serious sortassure you still smiling  . very seriouscan think of but one thing -- who is in love with her who makes you their confidant emma was more than half in hopes of mr  . eltonhaving dropthint  . mr  . knightley wassort of general friend and adviser and she knew mr  . elton looked up to him  .have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and frommost unexceptionable quarter -- robert martin is the man  . her visit to abbey - mill this summer seems to have done his business  . he is desperately in love and means to marry her  . he is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet means to marry him well well means to make her an offer then  . will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it  . he knowshavethorough regard for him and all his family andbelieve considers me as one of his best friends  . he came to ask me whetherthought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whetherthought her too young in short whetherapproved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as inline of society above him  .was very much pleased with all that he said  .never hear better sense from any one than robert martin  . he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging  . he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage  . he is an excellent young man both as son and brother  .had no hesitation in advising him to marry  . he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the casewas convinced he could not do better  .praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy  . if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then anddare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had  . this happened the night before last  . now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs  . goddardto - day and she may be detained byvisitor without thinking him at alltiresome wretch  . pray mr  . knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself throughgreat part of this speech how do you know that mr  . martin did not speak yesterday certainly replied he surprizeddo not absolutely know it but it may be inferred  . was not she the whole day with you come said shewill tell you something in return for what you have told me  . he did speak yesterday -- that is he wrote and was refused  . this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed and mr  . knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood up in tall indignation and said then she isgreater simpleton thanever believed her  . what is the foolish girl about oh to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible toman thatwoman should ever refuse an offer of marriage  .man always imagineswoman to be ready for any body who asks her  . nonsenseman does not imagine any such thing  . but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so buthope you are mistaken  .saw her answer -- nothing could be clearer  . you saw her answer -- you wrote her answer too  . emma this is your doing  . you persuaded her to refuse him  . and ifdid which howeveram far from allowingshould not feel thathad done wrong  . mr  . martin isvery respectable young man butcannot admit him to be harrietequal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her  . by your account he does seem to have had some scruples  . it ispity that they were ever got over  . not harrietequal exclaimed mr  . knightley loudly and warmly and with calmer asperity addedfew moments afterwards no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation  . emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you  . what are harriet smithclaims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations  . she is known only as parlour - boarder atcommon school  . she is notsensible girl norgirl of any information  . she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself  . at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her  . she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all  . my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts andbad connexion for him  .felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as torational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse  . butcould not reason so toman in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well  . the advantage of the matchfelt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor havenow that there would begeneral cry - out upon her extreme good luck  . even your satisfactionmade sure of  . it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friendleaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well  .remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think thisgood match  .cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing  . what thinkfarmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr  . martin is nothing moregood match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marryingman whomcould never admit as an acquaintance of my ownwonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings  .assure you mine are very different  .must think your statement by no means fair  . you are not just to harrietclaims  . they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr  . martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society  .-- the sphere in which she moves is much above his  .-- it would bedegradation  .degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married torespectable intelligent gentleman - farmer as to the circumstances of her birth though inlegal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense  . she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up  .-- there can scarcely bedoubt that her father isgentleman -- andgentleman of fortune  .-- her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort  .-- that she isgentlemandaughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemendaughters no oneapprehend will deny  .-- she is superior to mr  . robert martin  . whoever might be her parents said mr  . knightley whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society  . after receivingvery indifferent education she is left in mrs  . goddardhands to shift as she can -- to move in short in mrs  . goddardline to have mrs  . goddardacquaintance  . her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough  . she desired nothing better herself  . till you chose to turn her intofriend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it  . she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer  . she had no sense of superiority then  . if she has it now you have given it  . you have been no friend to harriet smith emma  . robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him  .know him well  . he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion  . and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any manknow  . depend upon it he had encouragement  . it was most convenient to emma not to makedirect reply to this assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again  . you arevery warm friend to mr  . martin but assaid before are unjust to harriet  . harrietclaims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them  . she is notclever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly  . waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good - natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in factbeautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome facesgirl with such loveliness as harriet hascertainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequentlyclaim to be nice  . her good - nature too is not so very slightclaim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and mannervery humble opinion of herself andgreat readiness to be pleased with other people  .am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claimswoman could possess  . upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too  . better be without sense than misapply it as you do  . to be sure cried she playfully  .know that is the feeling of you all  .know that suchgirl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment  . oh harriet may pick and chuse  . were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you  . and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no -- pray let her have time to look about her  .have always thought itvery foolish intimacy said mr  . knightley presently thoughhave kept my thoughts to myself butnow perceive that it will bevery unfortunate one for harriet  . you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she hasclaim to that inlittle while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her  . vanity working onweak head produces every sort of mischief  . nothing so easy as foryoung lady to raise her expectations too high  . miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she isvery pretty girl  . men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives  . men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves withgirl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed  . let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less thanman of consequence and large fortune she may beparlour - boarder at mrs  . goddardall the rest of her life -- or at least for harriet smith isgirl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing - masterson  . we think so very differently on this point mr  . knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it  . we shall only be making each other more angry  . but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedlythink as must prevent any second application  . she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itselfwill not pretend to say thatmight not influence herlittle butassure you there was very little for me or for any body to do  . his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now  .can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him  . he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey - mill find him disagreeable  . but the case is altered now  . she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing butgentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet  . nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr  . knightley  .-- robert martinmanners have sense sincerity and good - humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand  . emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone  . she did not repent what she had done she still thought herselfbetter judge of suchpoint of female right and refinement than he could be but yet she hadsort of habitual respect for his judgment in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable  . some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt on emmaside to talk of the weather but he made no answer  . he was thinking  . the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words  . robert martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so andhope it will not be long before he does  . your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match - making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have -- and asfriendshall just hint to you that if elton is the manthink it will be all labour in vain  . emma laughed and disclaimed  . he continued depend upon it elton will not do  . elton isvery good sort of man andvery respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match  . he knows the value ofgood income as well as any body  . elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally  . he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet . he knows that he isvery handsome young man andgreat favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men presentam convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away  .have heard him speak with great animation oflarge family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece  .am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again  . ifhad set my heart on mr  . eltonmarrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at presentonly want to keep harriet to myself  .have done with match - making indeed  .could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls  .shall leave off whileam well  . good morning to you -- said he rising and walking off abruptly  . he was very much vexed  . he felt the disappointment of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly  . emma remained instate of vexation too but there was more indistinctness in the causes of herthan in his  . she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversarywrong as mr  . knightley  . he walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her  . she was not so materially cast down however but thatlittle time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives  . harrietstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy  . the possibility of the young mancoming to mrs  . goddardthat morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas  . the dread of suchfailure after all became the prominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any such reason to give for her long absence she feltsatisfaction which settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let mr  . knightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which womanfriendship and womanfeelings would not justify  . he had frightened herlittle about mr  . elton but when she considered that mr  . knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of mr  . knightleypretensions with the skill of such an observer on suchquestion as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about  . he certainly might have heard mr  . elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and mr  . elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them but then mr  . knightley did not make due allowance for the influence ofstrong passion at war with all interested motives  . mr  . knightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects but she saw too much of it to feeldoubt of its overcoming any hesitations thatreasonable prudence might originally suggest and more thanreasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure did not belong to mr  . elton  . harrietcheerful look and manner established hers she came back not to think of mr  . martin but to talk of mr  . elton  . miss nash had been telling her something which she repeated immediately with great delight  . mr  . perry had been to mrs  . goddardto attendsick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met mr  . elton and found to his great surprize that mr  . elton was actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whist - club night which he had been never known to miss before and mr  . perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do mr  . elton had been determined to go on and had said invery particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something aboutvery enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious  . mr  . perry could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must belady in the case and he told him so and mr  . elton only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits  . miss nash had told her all this and had talkedgreat deal more about mr  . elton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom mr  . elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyonddoubt mr  . elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness  . chapter ix mr  . knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel with herself  . he was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven  . she was sorry but could not repent  . on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days  . the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after mr  . eltonreturn and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought and as for harrietfeelings they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted  . emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr  . martinbeing no otherwise remembered than as he furnishedcontrast with mr  . elton of the utmost advantage to the latter  . her views of improving her little friendmind bygreat deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more thanfew first chapters and the intention of going on to - morrow  . it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harrietfortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with intothin quarto of hot - pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies  . in this age of literature such collections onvery grand scale are not uncommon  . miss nash head - teacher at mrs  . goddardhad written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken the first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhousehelp to getgreat many more  . emma assisted with her invention memory and taste and as harriet wrotevery pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form as well as quantity  . mr  . woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in  . so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time  . and it always ended in kittyfair but frozen maid  . his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind but he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much something he thought might come from that quarter  . it was by no means his daughterwish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition  . mr  . elton was the only one whose assistance she asked  . he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathecompliment to the sex should pass his lips  . they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled and rather sentimentally recited that well - known charade my first doth affliction denote which my second is destinto feel and my whole is the best antidote that affliction to soften and heal  .-- made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already  . why will not you write one yourself for us mr  . elton said she that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you  . oh no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life  . the stupidest fellow he was afraid not even miss woodhouse -- he stoptmoment -- or miss smith could inspire him  . the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration  . he called forfew moments just to leavepiece of paper on the table containing as he saidcharade whichfriend of his had addressed toyoung lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own  .do not offer it for miss smithcollection said he  . being my friendi have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it  . the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could understand  . there was deep consciousness about him and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend . he was gone the next moment -- after another momentpause take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards harriet -- it is for you  . take your own  . but harriet was intremor and could not touch it and emma never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself  . to miss -- charade  . my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease  . another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas but ah united what reverse we have manboasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bendsslave and woman lovely woman reigns alone  . thy ready wit the word will soon supply may its approval beam in that soft eye she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness very well mr  . elton very well indeed  .have read worse charades  . courtship --very good hint  .give you credit for it  . this is feeling your way  . this is saying very plainly -- pray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you  . approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance  . may its approval beam in that soft eye harriet exactly  . soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets the justest that could be given  . thy ready wit the word will soon supply  . humph -- harrietready wit all the better  .man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so  . ah mr  . knightleywish you had the benefit of thisthink this would convince you  . for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken  . an excellent charade indeed and very much to the purpose  . things must come tocrisis soon now  . she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise ofsort to run into great length by the eagerness of harrietwondering questions  . what can it be miss woodhouse -- what can it behave not an idea --cannot guess it in the least  . what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse  . do help me  .never saw any thing so hard  . is it kingdomwonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady  . do you think it isgood one can it be woman and woman lovely woman reigns alone  . can it be neptune behold him there the monarch of the seas ortrident ormermaid orshark oh no shark is only one syllable  . it must be very clever or he would not have brought it  . oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing uscharade made byfriend uponmermaid orshark give me the paper and listen  . for miss ---------- read miss smith  . my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease  . that is court  . another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas that is ship -- plain as it can be  .-- now for the cream  . but ah united courtship you know what reverse we have manboasted power and freedom all are flown  . lord of the earth and sea he bendsslave and woman lovely woman reigns alone  .very proper compliment -- and then follows the application whichthink my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending  . read it in comfort to yourself  . there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you  . harriet could not long resist so delightfulpersuasion  . she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness  . she could not speak  . but she was not wanted to speak  . it was enough for her to feel  . emma spoke for her  . there is so pointed and so particularmeaning in this compliment said she thatcannot havedoubt as to mr  . eltonintentions  . you are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it  .thought it must be so  .thoughtcould not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever sinceknew you  . yes harriet just so long havebeen wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened  .could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr  . elton were most desirable or most natural  . its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each otheram very happy  .congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart  . this is an attachment whichwoman may well feel pride in creating  . this isconnexion which offers nothing but good  . it will give you every thing that you want -- consideration independenceproper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever  . this harriet is an alliance which can never raiseblush in either of us  . dear miss woodhouse -- and dear miss woodhouse was all that harriet with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered just as she ought  . mr  . eltonsuperiority had very ample acknowledgment  . whatever you say is always right cried harriet and thereforesuppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwisecould not have imagined it  . it is so much beyond any thingdeserve  . mr  . elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about him  . he is so very superior  . only think of those sweet verses -- to miss -------- . dear me how clever -- could it really be meant for mecannot makequestion or listen toquestion about that  . it iscertainty  . receive it on my judgment  . it issort of prologue to the playmotto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose  . it issort of thing which nobody could have expected  .am suremonth agohad no more idea myself -- the strangest things do take place when miss smiths and mr  . eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form  . you and mr  . elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes  . your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls  . there does seem to besomething in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow  . the course of true love never did run smooth --hartfield edition of shakespeare would havelong note on that passage  . that mr  . elton should really be in love with me -- me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was andman that every body looks up to quite like mr  . knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eatsingle meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week  . and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury  . dear me whenlook back to the first timesaw him how little didthink -- the two abbots andran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good - natured  . and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm - in - arm with mr  . cole  . this is an alliance which whoever -- whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools  . if they are anxious to see you happily married here isman whose amiable character gives every assurance of it -- if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them  . yes very true  . how nicely you talklove to hear you  . you understand every thing  . you and mr  . elton are one as clever as the other  . this charade -- ifhad studiedtwelvemonthcould never have made any thing like it  .thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday  .do think it is without exception the best charadeever read  .never read one more to the purpose certainly  . it is as long again as almost all we have had before  .do not consider its length as particularly in its favour  . such things in general cannot be too short  . harriet was too intent on the lines to hear  . the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind  . it is one thing said she presently -- her cheeks inglow -- to have very good sense incommon way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and writeletter and say just what you must inshort way and another to write verses and charades like this  . emma could not have desiredmore spirited rejection of mr  . martinprose  . such sweet lines continued harriet -- these two last -- but how shallever be able to return the paper or sayhave found it out -- oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that leave it to me  . you do nothing  . he will be here this eveningdare say and thenwill give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed  .-- your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming  . trust to me  . oh miss woodhouse whatpity thatmust not write this beautiful charade into my bookam surehave not got one half so good  . leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book  . oh but those two lines are -- -- the best of all  . granted -- for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them  . they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them  . the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change  . but take it away and all appropriation ceases andvery pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection  . depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion  .poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither  . give me the bookwill write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you  . harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing downdeclaration of love  . it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity  .shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she  . very well replied emmamost natural feeling and the longer it lasts the bettershall be pleased  . but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him  . it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays womancompliment  . he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all -- you must let me read it to him  . harriet looked grave  . my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade  .-- you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it  . do not be overpowered by suchlittle tribute of admiration  . if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper whilewas by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you  . do not let us be too solemn on the business  . he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade  . oh no --hopeshall not be ridiculous about it  . do as you please  . mr  . woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears how does your book go on -- have you got any thing fresh yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh  .piece of paper was found on the table this morning -- dropt we suppose byfairy -- containingvery pretty charade and we have just copied it in  . she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased and as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion  . aye thatvery just indeed thatvery properly said  . very true  . woman lovely woman  . it is suchpretty charade my dear thatcan easily guess what fairy brought it  .-- nobody could have written so prettily but you emma  . emma only nodded and smiled  .-- afterlittle thinking andvery tender sigh he added ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother was so clever at all those things ifhad but her memory butcan remember nothing -- not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mentioncan only recollect the first stanza and there are several  . kittyfair but frozen maid kindledflameyet deplore the hood - winkboycalled to aid though of his near approach afraid so fatal to my suit before  . and that is all thatcan recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through  . butthink my dear you said you had got it  . yes papa it is written out in our second page  . we copied it from the elegant extracts  . it was garrickyou know  . aye very true  .--wishcould recollect more of it  . kittyfair but frozen maid  . the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama  .hope we shall have her here next week  . have you thought my dear where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children oh yes -- she will have her own room of course the room she always has -- and there is the nursery for the children -- just as usual you know  . why should there be any changedo not know my dear -- but it is so long since she was here -- not since last easter and then only forfew days  .-- mr  . john knightleybeinglawyer is very inconvenient  .-- poor isabella -- she is sadly taken away from us all -- and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here she will not be surprized papa at least  .do not know my dear  .am surewas very much surprized whenfirst heard she was going to be married  . we must ask mr  . and mrs  . weston to dine with us while isabella is here  . yes my dear if there is time  .-- but -- invery depressed tone -- she is coming for only one week  . there will not be time for any thing  . it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seemscase of necessity  . mr  . john knightley must be in town again on the 28th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey  . mr  . knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him than with us  . it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield  . mr  . woodhouse could never allow for mr  . knightleyclaims on his brother or any bodyclaims on isabella except his own  . he sat musinglittle while and then said butdo not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does  .think emmashall try and persuade her to stay longer with us  . she and the children might stay very well  . ah papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish anddo not think you ever will  . isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband  . this was too true for contradiction  . unwelcome as it was mr  . woodhouse could only givesubmissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughterattachment to her husband she immediately led to suchbranch of the subject as must raise them  . harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here  .am sure she will be pleased with the children  . we are very proud of the children are not we papawonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john ayewonder which she will  . poor little dears how glad they will be to come  . they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet  .dare say they are sir  .am suredo not know who is not  . henry isfine boy but john is very like his mama  . henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father  . john the second is named after his father  . some people are surprizedbelieve that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry whichthought very pretty of her  . and he isvery clever boy indeed  . they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways  . they will come and stand by my chair and say grandpapa can you give mebit of string and once henry asked me forknife buttold him knives were only made for grandpapas  .think their father is too rough with them very often  . he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough  . he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give themsharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father -- certainly mr  . john knightley is an affectionate father  . the children are all fond of him  . and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling invery frightful way but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much  . it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other  . wellcannot understand it  . that is the case with us all papa  . one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other  . later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular fourclock dinner the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again  . harriet turned away but emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having madepush -- of having throwndie and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up  . his ostensible reason however was to ask whether mr  . woodhouseparty could be made up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield  . if he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made suchpoint of it that he had promised him conditionally to come  . emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber  . he re - urged -- she re - declined and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it -- oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it  . we admired it so much thathave ventured to write it into miss smithcollection  . your friend will not take it amisshope  . of coursehave not transcribed beyond the first eight lines  . mr  . elton certainly did not very well know what to say  . he looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused said something about honour -- glanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively  . with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said you must make my apologies to your friend but so goodcharade must not be confined to one or two  . he may be sure of every womanapprobation while he writes with such gallantry  .have no hesitation in saying replied mr  . elton though hesitatinggood deal while he spokehave no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all asdo --have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured assee it looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life  . after this speech he was gone as soon as possible  . emma could not think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities there wassort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh  . she ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harrietshare  . chapterthough now the middle of december there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow emma hadcharitable visit to pay topoor sick family who livedlittle way out of highbury  . their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lanelane leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of mr  . elton  .few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then aboutquarter ofmile down the lane rose the vicarage an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it could be  . it had no advantage of situation but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it withoutslackened pace and observing eyes  .-- emmaremark was -- there it is  . there go you and your riddle - book one of these days  . -- harrietwas -- oh whatsweet house -- how very beautiful -- there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much  .do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded but then there will be an inducement andshall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury  . harriet she found had never in her life been within side the vicarage and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors and probabilities emma could only class it asproof of love with mr  . eltonseeing ready wit in her  .wish we could contrive it said she butcannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in -- no servant thatwant to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father  . she pondered but could think of nothing  . aftermutual silence of some minutes harriet thus began again --do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are -- emma laughed and replied my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marrymust find other people charming -- one other person at least  . andam not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all  . ah -- so you say butcannot believe it  .must see somebody very superior to any onehave seen yet to be tempted mr  . elton you know recollecting herself is out of the question anddo not wish to see any such person  .would rather not be tempted  .cannot really change for the better  . ifwere to marrymust expect to repent it  . dear me -- it is so odd to hearwoman talk so --have none of the usual inducements of women to marry  . wereto fall in love indeed it would bedifferent thing butnever have been in love it is not my way or my nature anddo not thinkever shall  . and without loveam sureshould befool to change suchsituation as mine  . fortunedo not want employmentdo not want consequencedo not wantbelieve few married women are half as much mistress of their husbandhouse asam of hartfield and never never couldexpect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any maneyes asam in my father . but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and ifthoughtshould ever be like miss bates so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about mewould marry to - morrow  . but between usam convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried  . but still you will be an old maid and thatso dreadful never mind harrietshall not bepoor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible togenerous publicsingle woman withvery narrow income must beridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls butsingle woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else  . and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first forvery narrow income hastendency to contract the mind and sour the temper  . those who can barely live and who live perforce invery small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross  . this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor  . poverty certainly has not contracted her mindreally believe if she had onlyshilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that isgreat charm  . dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old ifknow myself harriet mine is an active busy mind withgreat many independent resources anddo not perceive whyshould be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty  . womanusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation  . ifdraw lessshall read more ifgive up musicshall take to carpet - work  . and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marryingshall be very well off with all the children ofsisterlove so much to care about  . there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need  . there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that ofparent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder  . my nephews and nieces --shall often haveniece with me  . do you know miss batesniece that isknow you must have seen herhundred times -- but are you acquainted oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury  . by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit withniece  . heaven forbid at least thatshould ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax  . one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax  . every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern ofstomacher or knitpair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else formonth  .wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death  . they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were superseded  . emma was very compassionate and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse  . she understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will  . in the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet as they walked away these are the sights harriet to do one good  . how trifling they make every thing else appear --feel now as ifcould think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind very true said harriet  . poor creatures one can think of nothing else  . and reallydo not think the impression will soon be over said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them into the lane again  .do not think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still greater within  . oh dear no said her companion  . they walked on  . the lane madeslight bend and when that bend was passed mr  . elton was immediately in sight and so near as to give emma time only to say farther ah harriet here comesvery sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts  . well smilinghope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important  . if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves  . harriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman joined them  . the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting  . he had been going to call on them  . his visit he would now defer but they hadvery interesting parley about what could be done and should be done  . mr  . elton then turned back to accompany them  . to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma to meet incharitable scheme this will bringgreat increase of love on each side  .should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration  . it must ifwere not here  .wishwere anywhere else  . anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession ofnarrow footpathlittle raised on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road  . but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriethabits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short they would both be soon after her  . this would not do she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in halfminute  . they did as they were desired and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken bychild from the cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield  . to walk by the side of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been acting just then without design and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her  . she gained on them however involuntarily the childpace was quick and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently inconversation which interested them  . mr  . elton was speaking with animation harriet listening withvery pleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw backlittle more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join them  . mr  . elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterdayparty at his friend coleand that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the cellery the beet - root and all the dessert  . this would soon have led to something better of course was her consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart  . ifcould but have kept longer away they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage pales whensudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and fall behind to arrange it once more  . she then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it intoditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort  . part of my lace is gone said she anddo not know howam to contrive  .really ammost troublesome companion to you both buthopeam not often so ill - equipped  . mr  . eltonmust beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper forbit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on  . mr  . elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage  . the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately communicated the door between them was open and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner  . she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it but she fully intended that mr  . elton should close it  . it was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room  . for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself  . it could be protracted no longer  . she was then obliged to be finished and make her appearance  . the lovers were standing together at one of the windows  . it hadmost favourable aspect and for halfminute emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully  . but it would not do he had not come to the point  . he had been most agreeable most delightful he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious  . cautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure  . still however though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them forward to the great event  . chapter xi mr  . elton must now be left to himself  . it was no longer in emmapower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures  . the coming of her sisterfamily was so very near at hand that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect -- that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers  . they might advance rapidly if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no  . she hardly wished to have more leisure for them  . there are people who the more you do for them the less they will do for themselves  . mr  . and mrs  . john knightley from having been longer than usual absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest  . till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children and it was therefore many months since they had been seen inregular way by their surry connexions or seen at all by mr  . woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london even for poor isabellasake and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit  . he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and notlittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and mr  . and mrs  . john knightley their five children andcompetent number of nursery - maids all reaching hartfield in safety  . the bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of producednoise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs  . john knightley that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be longdisturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them  . mrs  . john knightley waspretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners anddisposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her familydevoted wifedoating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher tieswarmer love might have seemed impossible  . she could never seefault in any of them  . she was notwoman of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also much of his constitution was delicate in her own health over - careful of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr  . wingfield in town as her father could be of mr  . perry  . they were alike too ingeneral benevolence of temper andstrong habit of regard for every old acquaintance  . mr  . john knightley wastall gentleman - like and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour  . he was not an ill - tempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve suchreproach but his temper was not his great perfection and indeed with suchworshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased  . the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his  . he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or saysevere thing  . he was notgreat favourite with his fair sister - in - law  . nothing wrong in him escaped her  . she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself  . perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabellasister but they were only those ofcalmly kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father  . there he had not always the patience that could have been wished  . mr  . woodhousepeculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him torational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed  . it did not often happen for mr  . john knightley had reallygreat regard for his father - in - law and generallystrong sense of what was due to him but it was too often for emmacharity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured though the offence came not  . the beginning however of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality  . they had not been long seated and composed when mr  . woodhouse withmelancholy shake of the head andsigh called his daughterattention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last  . ah my dear said he poor miss taylor -- it isgrievous business  . oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her and dear emma too -- whatdreadful loss to you both --have been so grieved for you  .--could not imagine how you could possibly do without her  .-- it issad change indeed  .-- buthope she is pretty well sir  . pretty well my dear --hope -- pretty well  .--do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably  . mr  . john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls  . oh no -- none in the least  .never saw mrs  . weston better in my life -- never looking so well  . papa is only speaking his own regret  . very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply  . and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father  . mr  . woodhouse hesitated  .-- not near so often my dear ascould wish  . oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married  . either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr  . weston or mrs  . weston and generally both either at randalls or here -- and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here  . they are very very kind in their visits  . mr  . weston is really as kind as herself  . papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabellafalse idea of us all  . every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr  . and mrs  . weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth  . just as it should be said mr  . john knightley and just ashoped it was from your letters  . her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his beingdisengaged and social man makes it all easy  .have been always telling you my love thathad no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emmaaccounthope you will be satisfied  . why to be sure said mr  . woodhouse -- yes certainly --cannot deny that mrs  . weston poor mrs  . weston does come and see us pretty often -- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again  . it would be very hard upon mr  . weston if she did not papa  .-- you quite forget poor mr  . weston  .think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr  . weston has some little claim  . you andemma will venture to take the part of the poor husband  .beinghusband and you not beingwife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force  . as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr  . westons aside as much as she can  . me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part  .-- are you talking about me --am sure nobody ought to be or can begreater advocate for matrimony thanam and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfieldshould never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr  . weston that excellent mr  . westonthink there is nothing he does not deserve  .believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed  . excepting yourself and your brotherdo not know his equal for temper  .shall never forget his flying henrykite for him that very windy day last easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelveclock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobhamhave been convinced there could not bemore feeling heart norbetter man in existence  .-- if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor  . where is the young man said john knightley  . has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not he has not been here yet replied emma  . there wasstrong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing andhave not heard him mentioned lately  . but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father  . he wroteletter to poor mrs  . weston to congratulate her andvery proper handsome letter it was  . she shewed it to me  .thought it very well done of him indeed  . whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell  . he is but young and his uncle perhaps -- my dear papa he is three - and - twenty  . you forget how time passes  . three - and - twenty -- is he indeed -- wellcould not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed -- and my memory is very bad  . however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr  . and mrs  . westongreat deal of pleasure  .remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept  . 28th -- and began my dear madam butforget how it went on and it was signed . . weston churchill  . --remember that perfectly  . how very pleasing and proper of him cried the good - hearted mrs  . john knightley  .have no doubt of his beingmost amiable young man  . but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking inchildbeing taken away from his parents and natural homenever could comprehend how mr  . weston could part with him  . to give up onechildreally never could think well of any body who proposed suchthing to any body else  . nobody ever did think well of the churchillsfancy observed mr  . john knightley coolly  . but you need not imagine mr  . weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john  . mr  . weston is rather an easy cheerful - tempered man thanman of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other dependingsuspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five timesweek than upon family affection or any thing that home affords  . emma could not like what bordered onreflection on mr  . weston and had halfmind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass  . she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all - sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brotherdisposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important  .-- it hadhigh claim to forbearance  . chapter xii mr  . knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of mr  . woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him in isabellafirst day  . emmasense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr  . knightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation  . she hoped they might now become friends again  . she thought it was time to make up  . making - up indeed would not do  . she certainly had not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had  . concession must be out of the question but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngestnice little girl about eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield and very happy to be danced about in her auntarms  . it did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity  . emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and thenlittle sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby whatcomfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces  . as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these childrenobserve we never disagree  . if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike  . to be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong  . yes said he smiling -- and reason good  .was sixteen years old when you were born  .material difference then she replied -- and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandingsgood deal nearer yes --good deal nearer  . but still not near enough to give mechance of being right if we think differently  .have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not beingpretty young woman andspoiled child  . come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it  . tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set youbetter example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now  . thattrue she cried -- very true  . little emma grow upbetter woman than your aunt  . be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited  . now mr  . knightleyword or two more andhave done  . as far as good intentions went we were both right andmust say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong  .only want to know that mr  . martin is not very very bitterly disappointed  .man cannot be more so was his short full answer  . ah -- indeedam very sorry  .-- come shake hands with me  . this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john knightley made his appearance and howye do george and john how are you succeeded in the true english style burying undercalmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the other  . the evening was quiet and conversable as mr  . woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions on one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr  . knightleys their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixing -- and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other  . the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative and who was always the greater talker  . asmagistrate he had generally some point of law to consult john about or at least some curious anecdote to give and asfarmer as keeping in hand the home - farm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting tobrother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong  . the plan ofdrain the change offence the felling oftree and the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his cooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approachedtone of eagerness  . while they were thus comfortably occupied mr  . woodhouse was enjoyingfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter  . my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand and interrupting forfew moments her busy labours for some one of her five children -- how long it is how terribly long since you were here and how tired you must be after your journey you must go to bed early my dear -- andrecommendlittle gruel to you before you go  .-- you andwill havenice basin of gruel together  . my dear emma suppose we all havelittle gruel  . emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the mr  . knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself -- and two basins only were ordered  . afterlittle more discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here  .never had much opinion of the sea air  . mr  . wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir -- or we should not have gone  . he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bellathroat -- both sea air and bathing  . ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myselfhave been long perfectly convinced though perhapsnever told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body  .am sure it almost killed me once  . come come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subjectmust beg you not to talk of the sea  . it makes me envious and miserable --who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please  . my dear isabellahave not heard you make one inquiry about mr  . perry yet and he never forgets you  . oh good mr  . perry -- how is he sir why pretty well but not quite well  . poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country  .suppose there is notman in such practice anywhere  . but then there is not so cleverman any where  . and mrs  . perry and the children how are they do the children growhavegreat regard for mr  . perry  .hope he will be calling soon  . he will be so pleased to see my little ones  .hope he will be here to - morrow forhavequestion or two to ask him about myself of some consequence  . and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bellathroat  . oh my dear sir her throat is so much better thathave hardly any uneasiness about it  . either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr  . wingfieldwhich we have been applying at times ever since august  . it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her -- and ifhad known you were wanting an embrocationwould have spoken to -- you seem to me to have forgotten mrs  . and miss bates said emmahave not heard one inquiry after them  . oh the good bateses --am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters  .hope they are quite well  . good old mrs  . bates --will call upon her to - morrow and take my children  .-- they are always so pleased to see my children  .-- and that excellent miss bates -- such thorough worthy people -- how are they sir why pretty well my dear upon the whole  . but poor mrs  . bates hadbad cold aboutmonth ago  . how sorryam but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn  . mr  . wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza  . that has beengood deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention  . perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november  . perry does not call it altogethersickly season  . nodo not know that mr  . wingfield considers it very sickly except -- ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is alwayssickly season  . nobody is healthy in london nobody can be  . it isdreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off -- and the air so bad no indeed -- we are not at all inbad air  . our part of london is very superior to most others -- you must not confound us with london in general my dear sir  . the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest  . we are so very airyshould be unwillingown to live in any other part of the town -- there is hardly any other thatcould be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airy -- mr  . wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air  . ah my dear it is not like hartfield  . you make the best of it -- but after you have beenweek at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same  . nowcannot say thatthink you are any of you looking well at present  .am sorry to hear you say so sir butassure you excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations whicham never entirely free from anywheream quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they werelittle more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming  .hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow forassure you mr  . wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case  .trust at least that you do not think mr  . knightley looking ill turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband  . middling my dearcannot compliment you  .think mr  . john knightley very far from looking well  . what is the matter sir -- did you speak to me cried mr  . john knightley hearing his own name  .am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well -- buthope it is only from beinglittle fatigued  .could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr  . wingfield before you left home  . my dear isabella -- exclaimed he hastily -- pray do not concern yourself about my looks  . be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look aschuse  .did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother cried emma about your friend mr  . grahamintending to havebailiff from scotland to look after his new estate  . what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing worse to hear than isabellakind inquiry after jane fairfax and jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising  . that sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs  . john knightley  .-- it is so long sincehave seen her except now and then formoment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit themalways regret excessively on dear emmaaccount that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is marriedsuppose colonel and mrs  . campbell will not be able to part with her at all  . she would be suchdelightful companion for emma  . mr  . woodhouse agreed to it all but added our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person  . you will like harriet  . emma could not havebetter companion than harriet  .am most happy to hear it -- but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior -- and exactly emmaage  . this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening did not close withoutlittle return of agitation  . the gruel came and suppliedgreat deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable -- but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at south endyoung woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant bybasin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin  . often as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable  . here wasdangerous opening  . ah said mr  . woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern  .-- the ejaculation in emmaear expressed ah there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end  . it does not bear talking of  . and forlittle while she hoped he would not talk of it and thatsilent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel  . after an interval of some minutes however he began withshall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here  . but why should you be sorry sir --assure you it did the childrengreat deal of good  . and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end  . south end is an unhealthy place  . perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end  .know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quitemistake sir  .-- we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr  . wingfield says it is entirelymistake to suppose the place unhealthy andam sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly  . you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere  .-- perry wasweek at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places  .fine open sea he says and very pure air  . and by whatunderstand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea --quarter ofmile off -- very comfortable  . you should have consulted perry  . but my dear sir the difference of the journey -- only consider how great it would have been  .-- an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty  . ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred  .-- better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get intoworse air  . this is just what perry said  . it seemed to himvery ill - judged measure  . emmaattempts to stop her father had been vain and when he had reached suchpoint as this she could not wonder at her brother - in - lawbreaking out  . mr  . perry said he invoice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for  . why does he make it any business of his to wonder at whatdo -- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another --may be allowedhope the use of my judgment as well as mr  . perry  .--want his directions no more than his drugs  . he paused -- and growing cooler inmoment added with only sarcastic dryness if mr  . perry can tell me how to conveywife and five childrendistance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience thandistance of fortyshould be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself  . true true cried mr  . knightley with most ready interposition -- very true  . thata consideration indeed  .-- but john as to whatwas telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadowscannot conceive any difficulty  .should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path  .  .  .  . the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps  .shall see you at the abbey to - morrow morninghope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion  . mr  . woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions -- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it  . chapter xiii there could hardly behappier creature in the world than mrs  . john knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister  . she had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly  . it wasdelightful visit -- perfect in being much too short  . in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas  . mr  . weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls one day -- even mr  . woodhouse was persuaded to think itpossible thing in preference todivision of the party  . how they were all to be conveyed he would have madedifficulty if he could but as his son and daughtercarriage and horses were actually at hartfield he was not able to make more thansimple question on that head it hardly amounted todoubt nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also  . harriet mr  . elton and mr  . knightley their own especial set were the only persons invited to meet them -- the hours were to be early as well as the numbers few mr  . woodhousehabits and inclination being consulted in every thing  . the evening before this great event for it wasvery great event that mr  . woodhouse should dine out on the 24th of december had been spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed withcold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs  . goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house  . emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls  . she was very feverish and hadbad sore throat mrs  . goddard was full of care and affection mr  . perry was talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss without many tears  . emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs  . goddardunavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much mr  . eltonwould be depressed when he knew her state and left her at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his havingmost comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much  . she had not advanced many yards from mrs  . goddarddoor when she was met by mr  . elton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield -- they were overtaken by mr  . john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit ofcountry run and seemed to ensurequick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for  . they joined company and proceeded together  . emma was just describing the nature of her friendcomplaint --throat very much inflamed withgreat deal of heat about herquick low pulse . and she was sorry to find from mrs  . goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats and had often alarmed her with them  . mr  . elton looked all alarm on the occasion as he exclaimedsore - throat --hope not infectious  .hope not ofputrid infectious sort  . has perry seen her indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend  . let me entreat you to run no risks  . why does not perry see her emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs  . goddardexperience and care but as there must still remaindegree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject it is so cold so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other partyshould really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himselfdo not like to interfere asknow it would be so greatdisappointment to mr  . and mrs  . weston  . but upon my word mr  . elton in your caseshould certainly excuse myself  . you appear to melittle hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bringthink it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night  . mr  . elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of suchfair lady and not liking to resist any advice of herhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit -- but emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening  . you do quite right said she -- we will make your apologies to mr  . and mrs  . weston  . but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly offeringseat in his carriage if the weather were mr  . eltononly objection and mr  . elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction  . it wasdone thing mr  . elton was to go and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her  . well said she to herself this is most strange -- afterhad got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behind -- most strange indeed -- but there isbelieve in many men especially single men such an inclination -- suchpassion for dining out --dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with mr  . eltonmost valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked  . whatstrange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her  . soon afterwards mr  . elton quitted them and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there wasgreat deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs  . goddardfor news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be able to givebetter report and he sighed and smiled himself off inway that left the balance of approbation much in his favour  . afterfew minutes of entire silence between them john knightley began with --never in my life sawman more intent on being agreeable than mr  . elton  . it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned  . with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works  . mr  . eltonmanners are not perfect replied emma but where there iswish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlookgreat deal  . whereman does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority  . there is such perfect good - temper and good - will in mr  . elton as one cannot but value  . yes said mr  . john knightley presently with some slyness he seems to havegreat deal of good - will towards you  . me she replied withsmile of astonishment are you imagining me to be mr  . eltonobject such an imagination has crossed meown emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now  . mr  . elton in love with me -- what an ideado not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly  .think your manners to him encouraging  .speak asfriend emma  . you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do  .thank you butassure you you are quite mistaken  . mr  . elton andare very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise frompartial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel  . he said no more  . mr  . woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it  . the cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage was in motionfew flakes of snow were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want onlymilder air to producevery white world invery short time  . emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour  . the preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which mr  . john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent  .man said he must havevery good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter suchday as this for the sake of coming to see him  . he must think himselfmost agreeable fellowcould not do suchthing  . it is the greatest absurdity -- actually snowing at this moment -- the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of peoplenot staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business whathardship we should deem it -- and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can -- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another manhouse with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to - morrow  . going in dismal weather to return probably in worse -- four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home  . emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all  . she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence  . she allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips  . they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and mr  . elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly  . emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject  . mr  . elton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have receiveddifferent account of harriet from what had reached her  . she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same -- not better  . my report from mrs  . goddardsaid she presently was not so pleasant ashad hoped -- not better was my answer  . his face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered  . oh no --am grieved to find --was on the point of telling you that whencalled at mrs  . goddarddoor whichdid the very last thing beforereturned to dresswas told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse  . very much grieved and concerned --had flattered myself that she must be better after suchcordial asknew had been given her in the morning  . emma smiled and answered -- my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complainthope but not evencan charm awaysore throat it ismost severe cold indeed  . mr  . perry has been with her as you probably heard  . yes --imagined -- that is --did not -- he has been used to her in these complaints andhope to - morrow morning will bring us bothmore comfortable report  . but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness  . suchsad loss to our party to - day dreadful -- exactly so indeed  .-- she will be missed every moment  . this was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable but it should have lasted longer  . emma was rather in dismay when only halfminute afterwards he began to speak of other things and invoice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment  . what an excellent device said he the use ofsheepskin for carriages  . how very comfortable they make it -- impossible to feel cold with such precautions  . the contrivances of modern days indeed have renderedgentlemancarriage perfectly complete  . one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that notbreath of air can find its way unpermitted  . weather becomes absolutely of no consequence  . it isvery cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter  .-- ha snowslittlesee  . yes said john knightley andthink we shall havegood deal of it  . christmas weather observed mr  . elton  . quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this dayparty which it might very possibly have done for mr  . woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence  . this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings  . at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather  .was snowed up atfriendhouse once forweek  . nothing could be pleasanter  .went for only one night and could not get away till that very day se nnight  . mr  . john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coollycannot wish to be snowed upweek at randalls  . at another time emma might have been amused but she was too much astonished now at mr  . eltonspirits for other feelings  . harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation ofpleasant party  . we are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort  . charming people mr  . and mrs  . weston -- mrs  . weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society -- it will besmall party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any  . mr  . westondining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my partwould rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two  .think you will agree with me turning withsoft air to emmathinkshall certainly have your approbation though mr  . knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings  .know nothing of the large parties of london sir --never dine with any body  . indeed intone of wonder and pityhad no idea that the law had been so greatslavery  . well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment  . my first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through the sweep - gate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again  . chapter xiv some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs  . westondrawing - room -- mr  . elton must compose his joyous looks and mr  . john knightley disperse his ill - humour  . mr  . elton must smile less and mr  . john knightley more to fit them for the place  .-- emma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as happy as she was  . to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons  . mr  . weston wasgreat favourite and there was notcreature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself  . she could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs  . weston had notlively concern and half an houruninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends was one of the first gratifications of each  . this waspleasure which perhaps the whole dayvisit might not afford which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour but the very sight of mrs  . weston her smile her touch her voice was grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as possible of mr  . eltonoddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost  . the misfortune of harrietcold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival  . mr  . woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and isabellacoming and of emmabeing to follow and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs  . weston who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma  . emmaproject of forgetting mr  . elton forwhile made her rather sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her  . the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion  . instead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me -- absurd and insufferable -- yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father and so delighted with mrs  . weston and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly likewould - be lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners  . for her own sake she could not be rude and for harrietin the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil but it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst the others in the most overpowering period of mr  . eltonnonsense which she particularly wished to listen to  . she heard enough to know that mr  . weston was giving some information about his son she heard the words my son and frank and my son repeated several times over and fromfew other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son but before she could quiet mr  . elton the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward  . now it so happened that in spite of emmaresolution of never marrying there was something in the name in the idea of mr  . frank churchill which always interested her  . she had frequently thought -- especially since his fathermarriage with miss taylor -- that if she were to marry he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition  . he seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her  . she could not but suppose it to bematch that every body who knew them must think of  . that mr  . and mrs  . weston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give upsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for she hadgreat curiosity to see himdecided intention of finding him pleasant of being liked by him tocertain degree andsort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations  . with such sensations mr  . eltoncivilities were dreadfully ill - timed but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again or the substance of it from the open - hearted mr  . weston  .-- so it proved -- for when happily released from mr  . elton and seated by mr  . weston at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to her we want only two more to be just the right number  .should like to see two more here -- your pretty little friend miss smith and my son -- and thenshould say we were quite complete  .believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting frank  .hadletter from him this morning and he will be with us withinfortnight  . emma spoke withvery proper degree of pleasure and fully assented to his proposition of mr  . frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete  . he has been wanting to come to us continued mr  . weston ever since september every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time  . he has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only bygood many sacrifices  . but nowhave no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january  . whatvery great pleasure it will be to you and mrs  . weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself  . yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another put - off  . she does not depend upon his coming so much asdo but she does not know the parties so well asdo  . the case you see is -- but this is quite between ourselvesdid not mentionsyllable of it in the other room  . there are secrets in all families you know -- the case is thatparty of friends are invited to payvisit at enscombe in january and that frankcoming depends upon their being put off  . if they are not put off he cannot stir  . butknow they will because it isfamily thatcertain lady of some consequence at enscombe hasparticular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point  .have not the smallest doubt of the issue  .am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january asam of being here myself but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects ashave been long in the practice of doing  .am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied emma but am disposed to side with you mr  . weston  . if you think he will comeshall think so too for you know enscombe  . yes --have some right to that knowledge thoughhave never been at the place in my life  .-- she is an odd woman -- butnever allow myself to speak ill of her on frankaccount fordo believe her to be very fond of him  .used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes  . and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for thoughwould not say it to any body else she has no more heart thanstone to people in general and the devil oftemper  . emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs  . weston very soon after their moving into the drawing - room wishing her joy -- yet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming  .-- mrs  . weston agreed to it but added that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety offirst meeting at the time talked of forcannot depend upon his coming  .cannot be so sanguine as mr  . weston  .am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing  . mr  . westondare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of mrs  . churchill whichimagine to be the most certain thing in the world  . my emma replied mrs  . weston smiling what is the certainty of caprice then turning to isabella who had not been attending before -- you must know my dear mrs  . knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr  . frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks  . it depends entirely upon his auntspirits and pleasure in short upon her temper  . to you -- to my two daughters --may venture on the truth  . mrs  . churchill rules at enscombe and isvery odd - tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him  . oh mrs  . churchill every body knows mrs  . churchill replied isabella andam surenever think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion  . to be constantly living with an ill - tempered person must be dreadful  . it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must belife of misery  . whatblessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them emma wished she had been alone with mrs  . weston  . she should then have heard more mrs  . weston would speak to her withdegree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge  . but at present there was nothing more to be said  . mr  . woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room  . to be sitting long after dinner wasconfinement that he could not endure  . neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable  . while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity of saying and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain  .am sorry for it  . the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better  . yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays  . even if this family the braithwaites are put offam still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us  .cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side butam sure there isgreat wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves  . there is jealousy  . they are jealous even of his regard for his father  . in shortcan feel no dependence on his coming andwish mr  . weston were less sanguine  . he ought to come said emma  . if he could stay onlycouple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceiveyoung mannot having it in his power to do as much as that  .young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept atdistance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehendyoung manbeing under such restraint as not to be able to spendweek with his father if he likes it  . one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied mrs  . weston  . one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombebelieve certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her  . but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very greatfavourite  . now according to my idea of mrs  . churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all  . my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understandbad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way  .have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be  . emma listened and then coolly saidshall not be satisfied unless he comes  . he may havegreat deal of influence on some points continued mrs  . weston and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us  . chapter xv mr  . woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared  . mr  . weston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation  . mr  . elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in  . mrs  . weston and emma were sitting together onsofa  . he joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them  . emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr  . frank churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles  . he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend -- her fair lovely amiable friend  . did she know -- had she heard any thing about her since their being at randalls -- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably  . and in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror ofbad sore throat and emma was quite in charity with him  . but at last there seemedperverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its beingbad sore throat on her account than on harriet-- more anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint  . he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again for the present -- to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr  . perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her  . she was vexed  . it did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty in behaving with temper  . he turned to mrs  . weston to implore her assistance would not she give him her support -- would not she add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs  . goddardtill it were certain that miss smithdisorder had no infection he could not be satisfied withoutpromise -- would not she give him her influence in procuring it so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for herself she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself  . is this fair mrs  . weston -- judge between us  . have notsome right to complainam sure of your kind support and aid  . emma saw mrs  . westonsurprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose  . she could only give himlook but it was suchlook as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing toseat by her sister and giving her all her attention  . she had not time to know how mr  . elton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for mr  . john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing fast withstrong drifting wind concluding with these words to mr  . woodhouse this will provespirited beginning of your winter engagements sir  . something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way throughstorm of snow  . poor mr  . woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer  . mrs  . weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly  .admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon  . every body must have seen the snow coming on  .admired your spirit anddare say we shall get home very well  . another hour or twosnow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand  .dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight  . mr  . weston with triumph ofdifferent sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not saidword lest it should make mr  . woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away  . as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that wasmere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty  . he wished the road might be impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him that withlittle contrivance every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house  . what is to be done my dear emma -- what is to be done was mr  . woodhousefirst exclamation and all that he could say for some time  . to her he looked for comfort and her assurances of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses and of james and of their having so many friends about them revived himlittle  . his eldest daughteralarm was equal to his own  . the horror of being blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but instate that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain at randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them  . you had better order the carriage directly my love said shedare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very badcan get out and walk  .am not at all afraid  .should not mind walking half the way  .could change my shoes you know the momentgot home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold  . indeed replied he  . then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold  . walk home -- you are prettily shod for walking homedare say  . it will be bad enough for the horses  . isabella turned to mrs  . weston for her approbation of the plan  . mrs  . weston could only approve  . isabella then went to emma but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away and they were still discussing the point when mr  . knightley who had left the room immediately after his brotherfirst report of the snow came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence  . he had gone beyond the sweep -- some way along the highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the groundvery few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon over  . he had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend  . to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her fatheraccount who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls  . he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending mr  . knightley and emma settled it infew brief sentences thus -- your father will not be easy why do not you goam ready if the others are  . shallring the bell yes do  . and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for  .few minutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over  . the carriage came and mr  . woodhouse always the first object on such occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr  . knightley and mr  . weston but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen and the discovery ofmuch darker night than he had been prepared for  . he was afraid they should havevery bad drive  . he was afraid poor isabella would not like it  . and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind  . he did not know what they had best do  . they must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to and givencharge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage  . isabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr  . elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them and that they were to havetete -- tete drive  . it would not have been the awkwardness ofmoment it would have been ratherpleasure previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked to him of harriet and the three - quarters ofmile would have seemed but one  . but now she would rather it had not happened  . she believed he had been drinking too much of mr  . westongood wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense  . to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded and mr  . elton actually making violent love to her availing himself of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible  . it really was so  . without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence mr  . elton the lover of harriet was professing himself her lover  . she tried to stop him but vainly he would go on and say it all  . angry as she was the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak  . she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour  . accordingly withmixture of the serious and the playful which she hoped would best suit his half and half state she repliedam very much astonished mr  . elton  . this to me you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to miss smithshall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please  . miss smith -- message to miss smith -- what could she possibly mean -- and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness mr  . elton this is the most extraordinary conduct andcan account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in suchmanner  . command yourself enough to say no more andwill endeavour to forget it  . but mr  . elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects  . he perfectly knew his own meaning and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend -- but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at all -- he resumed the subject of his own passion and was very urgent forfavourable answer  . as she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied it is impossible for me to doubt any longer  . you have made yourself too clear  . mr  . elton my astonishment is much beyond any thingcan express  . after such behaviour ashave witnessed during the last month to miss smith -- such attentions ashave been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character indeed whichhad not supposed possible believe me siram far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions  . good heaven cried mr  . elton what can be the meaning of this -- miss smith --never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend  . if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her andam very sorry -- extremely sorry -- but miss smith indeed -- oh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character  .have thought only of you  .protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else  . every thing thathave said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself  . you cannot really seriously doubt it  . no -- in an accent meant to be insinuating --am sure you have seen and understood me  . it would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing this -- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost  . she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr  . eltonsanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed -- charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence  . it confesses that you have long understood me  . no sir cried emma it confesses no such thing  . so far from having long understood youhave been inmost complete error with respect to your views till this moment  . as to myselfam very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend harriet -- your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure andhave been very earnestly wishing you success but hadsupposed that she were not your attraction to hartfieldshould certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent  . amto believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith -- that you have never thought seriously of her never madam cried he affronted in his turn neverassure you  .think seriously of miss smith -- miss smith isvery good sort of girl andshould be happy to see her respectably settled  .wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to -- every body has their level but as for myselfam notthink quite so much atloss  .need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith -- no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragementreceived -- encouragement --give you encouragement -- sir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it  .have seen you only as the admirer of my friend  . in no other light could you have been more to me thancommon acquaintance  .am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does  . had the same behaviour continued miss smith might have been led intomisconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of  . but as it is the disappointment is single andtrust will not be lasting  .have no thoughts of matrimony at present  . he was too angry to say another word her manner too decided to invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment and mutually deep mortification they had to continue togetherfew minutes longer for the fears of mr  . woodhouse had confined them tofoot - pace  . if there had not been so much anger there would have been desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment  . without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped they found themselves all at once at the door of his house and he was out before another syllable passed  .-- emma then felt it indispensable to wish himgood night  . the compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to hartfield  . there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who had been trembling for the dangers ofsolitary drive from vicarage lane -- turningcorner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands --mere common coachman -- no james and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well for mr  . john knightley ashamed of his ill - humour was now all kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him inbasin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herself  .-- but her mind had never been in such perturbation and it neededvery strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection  . chapter xvi the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think and be miserable  .-- it waswretched business indeed -- such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for -- suchdevelopment of every thing most unwelcome -- suchblow for harriet -- that was the worst of all  . every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken -- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment than she actually was could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself  . ifhad not persuaded harriet into liking the mancould have borne any thing  . he might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor harriet how she could have been so deceived -- he protested that he had never thought seriously of harriet -- never she looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion  . she had taken up the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it  . his manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so misled  . the picture -- how eager he had been about the picture -- and the charade -- and an hundred other circumstances -- how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet  . to be sure the charade with its ready wit -- but then the soft eyes -- in fact it suited neither it wasjumble without taste or truth  . who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way asmere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harrietfriend  . to mr  . john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject for the first start of its possibility  . there was no denying that those brothers had penetration  . she remembered what mr  . knightley had once said to her about mr  . elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that mr  . elton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truerknowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself  . it was dreadfully mortifying but mr  . elton was proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full of his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others  . contrary to the usual course of things mr  . eltonwanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion  . his professions and his proposals did him no service  . she thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes  . he wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for  . there had been no real affection either in his language or manners  . sighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less allied with real love  . she need not trouble herself to pity him  . he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty or with ten  . but -- that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry him -- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind -- look down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her -- it was most provoking  . perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind  . the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior  . he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield the younger branch ofvery ancient family -- and that the eltons were nobody  . the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable being butsort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself in every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long heldhigh place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr  . elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility  .-- but he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after ravinglittle about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners andconceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrantman of ordinary observation and delicacy like mr  . elton in fancying himselfvery decided favourite  . if she had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder that he with self - interest to blind him should have mistaken hers  . the first error and the worst lay at her door  . it was foolish it was wrong to take so activepart in bringing any two people together  . it was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serioustrick of what ought to be simple  . she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more  . here havesaid she actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man  . she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope ifhad not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble asused to think him  . oh thathad been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin  . therewas quite right  . that was well done of me but thereshould have stopped and left the rest to time and chance  .was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth havingought not to have attempted more  . but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time  .have been but halffriend to her and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very mucham surehave not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her -- william coxe -- oh nocould not endure william coxe --pert young lawyer  . she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumedmore serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be and must be  . the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully  . to youth and natural cheerfulness like emmathough under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits  . the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope  . emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it  . it wasgreat consolation that mr  . elton should not be really in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that harrietnature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any bodyknowing what had passed except the three principals and especially for her fatherbeing givenmomentuneasiness about it  . these were very cheering thoughts and the sight ofgreat deal of snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present  . the weather was most favourable for her though christmas day she could not go to church  . mr  . woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas  . the ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many daysmost honourable prisoner  . no intercourse with harriet possible but by note no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no need to find excuses for mr  . eltonabsenting himself  . it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr  . knightley whom no weather could keep entirely from them -- ah mr  . knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr  . elton these days of confinement would have been but for her private perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield  . he was always agreeable and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body  . but with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease  . chapter xvii mr  . and mrs  . john knightley were not detained long at hartfield  . the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move and mr  . woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella -- which poor isabella passing her life with those she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently busy might have beenmodel of right feminine happiness  . the evening of the very day on which they went broughtnote from mr  . elton to mr  . woodhouselong civil ceremonious note to say with mr  . eltonbest compliments that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath where in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spendfew weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from various circumstances of weather and business of takingpersonal leave of mr  . woodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever retaingrateful sense -- and had mr  . woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them  . emma was most agreeably surprized  .-- mr  . eltonabsence just at this time was the very thing to be desired  . she admired him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced  . resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than incivility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded  . she had not evenshare in his opening compliments  .-- her name was not mentioned -- and there was so strikingchange in all this and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her fathersuspicion  . it did however  .-- her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so suddenjourney and his fears that mr  . elton might never get safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language  . it wasvery useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening  . mr  . woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude  . she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark  . she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentlemanreturn  . she went to mrs  . goddardaccordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary penance of communication andsevere one it was  .-- she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last six weeks  . the confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of harriettears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again  . harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend  . emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on harrietside not her own  . harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of  . the affection of suchman as mr  . elton would have been too greatdistinction  .-- she never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kindfriend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible  . her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmaeyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do  . it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of her life  . her second duty now inferior only to her fatherclaims was to promote harrietcomfort and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making  . she got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation to drive mr  . elton from her thoughts  . time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr  . elton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harrietage and with the entire extinction of all hope suchprogress might be made towardsstate of composure by the time of mr  . eltonreturn as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them  . harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did in truth prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen but yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force  . if mr  . elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine harrietpersisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him  . their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for each for all three  . not one of them had the power of removal or of effecting any material change of society  . they must encounter each other and make the best of it  . harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs  . goddardmr  . elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth  . where the wound had been given there must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace for herself  . chapter xviii mr  . frank churchill did not come  . when the time proposed drew near mrs  . westonfears were justified in the arrival ofletter of excuse  . for the present he could not be spared to his very great mortification and regret but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period  . mrs  . weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober butsanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression  . it soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again  . for half an hour mr  . weston was surprized and sorry but then he began to perceive that frankcoming two or three months later would bemuch better plan better time of year better weather and that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner  . these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs  . weston ofmore apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing butrepetition of excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer sufferedgreat deal more herself  . emma was not at this time instate of spirits to care really about mr  . frank churchillnot coming except asdisappointment at randalls  . the acquaintance at present had no charm for her  . she wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it was desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into mr  . and mrs  . westondisappointment as might naturally belong to their friendship  . she was the first to announce it to mr  . knightley and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary or being actingpart perhaps rather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away  . she then proceeded to saygood deal more than she felt of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry the pleasure of looking at somebody new the gala - day to highbury entire which the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections on the churchills again found herself directly involved indisagreement with mr  . knightley and to her great amusement perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making use of mrs  . westonarguments against herself  . the churchills are very likely in fault said mr  . knightley coolly butdare say he might come if he would  .do not know why you should say so  . he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him  .cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he madepoint of it  . it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof  . how odd you are what has mr  . frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creatuream not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it  . it isgreat deal more natural than one could wish thatyoung man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too  . if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january  .man at his age -- what is he -- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that  . it is impossible  . thateasily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master  . you are the worst judge in the world mr  . knightley of the difficulties of dependence  . you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage  . it is not to be conceived thatman of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount  . he cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure  . we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom  . we hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other  .little while ago he was at weymouth  . this proves that he can leave the churchills  . yes sometimes he can  . and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure  . it is very unfair to judge of any bodyconduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation  . nobody who has not been in the interior offamily can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be  . we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs  . churchilltemper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do  . he may at times be able to dogreat deal more than he can at others  . there is one thing emma whichman can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution  . it is frank churchillduty to pay this attention to his father  . he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done  .man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs  . churchill -- every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience butmust go and see my father immediately  .know he would be hurt by my failing in suchmark of respect to him on the present occasion  .shall therefore set off to - morrow  . -- if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becomingman there would be no opposition made to his going  . no said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again  . such language foryoung man entirely dependent to use -- nobody but you mr  . knightley would imagine it possible  . but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own  . mr  . frank churchill to be making suchspeech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him -- standing up in the middle of the roomsuppose and speaking as loud as he could -- how can you imagine such conduct practicable depend upon it emmasensible man would find no difficulty in it  . he would feel himself in the right and the declaration -- made of course asman of sense would make it inproper manner -- would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all thatline of shifts and expedients can ever do  . respect would be added to affection  . they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims  . respect for right conduct is felt by every body  . if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his  .rather doubt that  . you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authoritythink they haveknack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones  .can imagine that if you as you are mr  . knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr  . frank churchillsituation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might havevery good effect  . the churchills might not haveword to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through  . to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought  . he may have as strongsense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it  . then it would not be so strongsense  . if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction  . oh the difference of situation and habitwish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life  . our amiable young man isvery weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying throughresolution to do right against the will of others  . it ought to have beenhabit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency  .can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man  . as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority  . he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father  . had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now  . we shall never agree about him cried emma but that is nothing extraordinary  .have not the least idea of his beingweak young manfeel sure that he is not  . mr  . weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to havemore yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of manperfection  .dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others  . yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leadinglife of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it  . he can sit down and writefine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his fatherhaving any right to complain  . his letters disgust me  . your feelings are singular  . they seem to satisfy every body else  .suspect they do not satisfy mrs  . weston  . they hardly can satisfywoman of her good sense and quick feelings standing inmotherplace but withoutmotheraffection to blind her  . it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission  . had she beenperson of consequence herself he would have comedare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no  . can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english  . he may be very aimable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him  . you seem determined to think ill of him  . me -- not at all replied mr  . knightley rather displeaseddo not want to think ill of him  .should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man buthear of none except what are merely personal that he is well - grown and good - looking with smooth plausible manners  . well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will betreasure at highbury  . we do not often look upon fine young men well - bred and agreeable  . we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain  . cannot you imagine mr  . knightley whatsensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest -- one object of curiosity it will be all mr  . frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else  . you will excuse my being so much over - powered  . iffind him conversableshall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is onlychattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts  . my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable  . to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him  . and mine said mr  . knightley warmly is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man -- the practised politician who is to read every bodycharacter and make every bodytalents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure suchpuppy when it came to the point  .will say no more about him cried emma you turn every thing to evil  . we are both prejudiced you againstfor him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here  . prejudicedam not prejudiced  . butam very much and without being at all ashamed of it  . my love for mr  . and mrs  . weston gives medecided prejudice in his favour  . he ispersonnever think of from one monthend to another said mr  . knightley withdegree of vexation which made emma immediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be angry  . to takedislike toyoung man only because he appeared to be ofdifferent disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had never before formoment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another  . volume ii chapteremma and harriet had been walking together one morning and in emmaopinion had been talking enough of mr  . elton for that day  . she could not think that harrietsolace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned -- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer thanvery plaintive -- mr  . elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done  . they were just approaching the house where lived mrs  . and miss bates  . she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers  . there was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs  . and miss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts  . she had had manyhint from mr  . knightley and some from her own heart as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable --waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of highbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore she seldom went near them  . but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing as she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax  . the house belonged to people in business  . mrs  . and miss bates occupied the drawing - room floor and there in the very moderate - sized apartment which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr  . woodhousehealth cheerful communications about her motherand sweet - cake from the beaufet -- mrs  . cole had just been there just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an hour with them and she had takenpiece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eatpiece too  . the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr  . elton  . there was intimacy between them and mr  . cole had heard from mr  . elton since his going away  . emma knew what was coming they must have the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone and how much he was engaged in company and whatfavourite he was wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies ball had been and she went through it very well with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always putting forward to prevent harrietbeing obliged to sayword  . this she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury and their card - parties  . she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr  . elton but he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles to usher inletter from her niece  . oh yes -- mr  . eltonunderstand -- certainly as to dancing -- mrs  . cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was -- mrs  . cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very greatfavourite there  . whenever she is with us mrs  . cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough andmust say that jane deserves it as much as any body can  . and so she began inquiring after her directly sayingknow you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time for writing and whenimmediately said but indeed we have we hadletter this very morningdo not know thatever saw any body more surprized  . have you upon your honour said she well that is quite unexpected  . do let me hear what she says  . emmapoliteness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest -- have you heard from miss fairfax so latelyam extremely happy  .hope she is well thank you  . you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt while eagerly hunting for the letter  .-- oh here it is  .was sure it could not be far off buthad put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid buthad it in my hand so very lately thatwas almost sure it must be on the table  .was reading it to mrs  . cole and since she went awaywas reading it again to my mother for it is suchpleasure to her --letter from jane -- that she can never hear it often enough soknew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says -- but first of allreally must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so shortletter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half  . my mother often wonders thatcan make it out so well  . she often says when the letter is first opened well hetty nowthink you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work -- donyou ma am -- and thentell heram sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it --am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word  . and indeed though my mothereyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles  . it is suchblessing my motherare really very good indeed  . jane often says when she is heream sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too --only wish my eyes may last me as well  . all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfaxhandwriting  . you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified you who are suchjudge and write so beautifully yourself  .am sure there is nobodypraise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse . my mother does not hear she islittle deaf you know  . ma am addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about janehandwriting and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it  . she was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very rude of making her escape from jane fairfaxletter and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention  . my motherdeafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all  . by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice  . but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me  . jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is sayinggreat deal at my mothertime of life -- and it really is full two years you know since she was here  . we never were so long without seeing her before and aswas telling mrs  . cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now  . are you expecting miss fairfax here soon oh yes next week  . indeed -- that must bevery great pleasure  . thank you  . you are very kind  . yes next week  . every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things  .am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her  . yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days  . so very good of them to send her the whole way but they always do you know  . oh yes friday or saturday next  . that is what she writes about  . that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday  . yes soimagined  .was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to - day  . so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon  . my mother is so delighted -- for she is to be three months with us at least  . three months she says so positively asam going to have the pleasure of reading to you  . the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland  . mrs  . dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly  . they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married last october she was never away from them so much asweek which must make it very strange to be in different kingdomswas going to say but however different countries and so she wrotevery urgent letter to her mother -- or her fatherdeclaredo not know which it was but we shall see presently in janeletter -- wrote in mr  . dixonname as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat baly - craigbeautiful placefancy  . jane has heardgreat deal of its beauty from mr  . dixonmean --do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for colonel and mrs  . campbell were very particular about their daughternot walking out often with only mr  . dixon for whichdo not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland andthink she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself  . he ismost amiable charming young manbelieve  . jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things  . at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emmabrain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr  . dixon and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at suchtime  . considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs  . dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs  . campbell  . very true very true indeed  . the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at suchdistance from us for months together -- not able to come if any thing was to happen  . but you see every thing turns out for the best  . they want her mr  . and mrs  . dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs  . campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr  . dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention  . he ismost charming young man  . ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit --can never think of it without trembling -- but ever since we had the history of that dayhave been so fond of mr  . dixon but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs  . bates yes -- entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs  . campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately  .am concerned to hear of it  .think they judge wisely  . but mrs  . dixon must be very much disappointed  . mrs  . dixonunderstand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax  . oh no  . you are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not  . there is no comparison between them  . miss campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable  . yes that of course  . jane caughtbad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november asam going to read to you and has never been well since  .long time is not it forcold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us  . just like her so considerate -- but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her -- and it is certainlygreat deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell  . nobody could nurse her as we should do  . it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world  . and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following -- as you will find from janeletter  . so sudden -- you may guess dear miss woodhouse whatflurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness -- butam afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly  .must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that  .always makepoint of reading janeletters through to myself first beforeread them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her  . jane desired me to do it soalways do and sobegan to - day with my usual caution but no sooner didcome to the mention of her being unwell thanburst out quite frightened with bless me poor jane is ill -- which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at  . however whenread onfound it was not near so bad ashad fancied at first andmake so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it  . butcannot imagine howcould be so off my guard  . if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr  . perry  . the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane thatdare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know  . he haswife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time  . well nowhave just given youhint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter andam sure she tells her own storygreat deal better thancan tell it for her  .am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet and beginning to rise -- my father will be expecting us  .had no intentionthoughthad no power of staying more than five minutes whenfirst entered the house  .merely called becausewould not pass the door without inquiring after mrs  . bates buthave been so pleasantly detained now however we must wish you and mrs  . bates good morning  . and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded  . she regained the street -- happy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfaxletter she had been able to escape the letter itself  . chapter ii jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs  . batesyoungest daughter  . the marriage of lieut  . fairfax of the regiment of infantry and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl  . by birth she belonged to highbury and when at three years old on losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation the fondling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there of her being taught only what very limited means could command and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what nature had given her inpleasing person good understanding and warm - hearted well - meaning relations  . but the compassionate feelings offriend of her father gavechange to her destiny  . this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for such attentions duringsevere camp - fever as he believed had saved his life  . these were claims which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in his power  . when he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her  . he wasmarried man with only one living childgirl about janeage and jane became their guest paying them long visits and growingfavourite with all and before she was nine years old his daughtergreat fondness for her and his own wish of beingreal friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education  . it was accepted and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbellfamily and had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time  . the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible  . to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbellpower for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughterbut by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter  . such was jane fairfaxhistory  . she had fallen into good hands known nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given an excellent education  . living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbellresidence being in london every lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of first - rate masters  . her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children fully competent to the office of instruction herself but she was too much beloved to be parted with  . neither father nor mother could promote and the daughter could not endure it  . the evil day was put off  . it was easy to decide that she was still too young and jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society andjudicious mixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over  . the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of janedecided superiority both in beauty and acquirements  . that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents  . they continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of mr  . dixonyoung man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn  . this event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning  . she had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period  . with the fortitude ofdevoted novitiate she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever  . the good sense of colonel and mrs  . campbell could not oppose suchresolution though their feelings did  . as long as they lived no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly but this would be selfishness -- what must be at last had better be soon  . perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared her fromtaste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished  . still however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment  . she had never been quite well since the time of their daughtermarriage and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being compatible withweakened frame and varying spirits seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort  . with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths not told  . it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more onfew months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else  . certain it was that she was to come and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- mr  . frank churchill -- must put up for the present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness oftwo years absence  . emma was sorry -- to have to pay civilities toperson she did not like through three long months -- to be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought why she did not like jane fairfax might bedifficult question to answer mr  . knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her  . but she could never get acquainted with her she did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then her aunt was such an eternal talker -- and she was made suchfuss with by every body -- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other  . these were her reasons -- she had no better  . it wasdislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival aftertwo years interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating  . jane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had herself the highest value for elegance  . her height was pretty just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall her figure particularly graceful her sizemost becoming medium between fat and thin thoughslight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two  . emma could not but feel all this and then her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty  . her eyesdeep grey with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour hadclearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom  . it wasstyle of beauty of which elegance was the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her principles admire it -- elegance which whether of person or of mind she saw so little in highbury  . there not to be vulgar was distinction and merit  . in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer  . when she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect especially if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr  . dixon which she had so naturally started to herself  . in that case nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on  . emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr  . dixonactions from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first  . if it were love it might be simple single successless love on her side alone  . she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison whilesharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit to ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty  . upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her  . these were charming feelings -- but not lasting  . before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax or done more towardsrecantation of past prejudices and errors than saying to mr  . knightley she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state  . former provocations reappeared  . the aunt was as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how smallslice of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself and janeoffences rose again  . they had music emma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance  . she was besides which was the worst of all so cold so cautious there was no getting at her real opinion  . wrapt up incloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing  . she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved  . if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing  . she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr  . dixoncharacter or her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match  . it was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished  . it did her no service however  . her caution was thrown away  . emma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises  . there probably was something more to conceal than her own preference mr  . dixon perhaps had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds  . the like reserve prevailed on other topics  . she and mr  . frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time  . it was known that they werelittle acquainted but notsyllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was  . was he handsome -- she believed he was reckonedvery fine young man  . was he agreeable -- he was generally thought so  . did he appearsensible young manyoung man of information -- atwatering - place or incommon london acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points  . manners were all that could be safely judged of undermuch longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr  . churchill  . she believed every body found his manners pleasing  . emma could not forgive her  . chapter iii emma could not forgive her -- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr  . knightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr  . woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma  . he had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement  .very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr  . woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers swept away -- particularly pleasant  . you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music  .do not knowmore luxurious state sir than sitting at oneease to be entertainedwhole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation  .am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma  . you left nothing undone  .was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmotherit must have beenreal indulgence  .am happy you approved said emma smiling buthopeam not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield  . no my dear said her father instantly thatam sure you are not  . there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are  . if any thing you are too attentive  . the muffin last night -- if it had been handed round oncethink it would have been enough  . no said mr  . knightley nearly at the same time you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension  .think you understand me therefore  . an arch look expressed --understand you well enough but she said only miss fairfax is reserved  .always told you she was --little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence  . what arises from discretion must be honoured  . you think her diffident  .do not see it  . my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her you are not going to tell mehope that you had notpleasant evening  . oh nowas pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little informationobtained  .am disappointed was his only answer  .hope every body hadpleasant evening said mr  . woodhouse in his quiet way  .had  . oncefelt the fire rather too much but thenmoved back my chairlittlevery little and it did not disturb me  . miss bates was very chatty and good - humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick  . however she is very agreeable and mrs  . bates too indifferent way  .like old friends and miss jane fairfax isvery pretty sort of young ladyvery pretty andvery well - behaved young lady indeed  . she must have found the evening agreeable mr  . knightley because she had emma  . true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax  . emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and withsincerity which no one could question -- she issort of elegant creature that one cannot keep oneeyes from  .am always watching her to admire anddo pity her from my heart  . mr  . knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express and before he could make any reply mr  . woodhouse whose thoughts were on the batessaid -- it isgreat pity that their circumstances should be so confinedgreat pity indeed andhave often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small trifling presents of any thing uncommon -- now we have killedporker and emma thinks of sending themloin orleg it is very small and delicate -- hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork --think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so my dear my dear papasent the whole hind - quarter  .knew you would wish it  . there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like  . thatright my dear very right  .had not thought of it before but that is the best way  . they must not over - salt the leg and then if it is not over - salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of withboiled turnip andlittle carrot or parsnipdo not consider it unwholesome  . emma said mr  . knightley presentlyhavepiece of news for you  . you like news -- andheard an article in my way hither thatthink will interest you  . news oh yesalways like news  . what is it -- why do you smile so -- where did you hear it -- at randalls he had time only to say no not at randallshave not been near randalls when the door was thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room  . full of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to give quickest  . mr  . knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him  . oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse --come quite over - powered  . suchbeautiful hind - quarter of pork you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr  . elton is going to be married  . emma had not had time even to think of mr  . elton and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoidlittle start andlittle blush at the sound  . there is my news --thought it would interest you said mr  . knightley withsmile which impliedconviction of some part of what had passed between them  . but where could you hear it cried miss bates  . where could you possibly hear it mr  . knightley for it is not five minutes sincereceived mrs  . colenote -- no it cannot be more than five -- or at least ten -- forhad got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out --was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork -- jane was standing in the passage -- were not you jane -- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough  . sosaidwould go down and see and jane said shallgo down instead forthink you havelittle cold and patty has been washing the kitchen  . -- oh my dear said-- well and just then came the note  .miss hawkins -- thatallknow  .miss hawkins of bath  . but mr  . knightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr  . cole told mrs  . cole of it she sat down and wrote to me  .miss hawkins --was with mr  . cole on business an hour andhalf ago  . he had just read eltonletter aswas shewn in and handed it to me directly  . well that is quite --suppose there never waspiece of news more generally interesting  . my dear sir you really are too bountiful  . my mother desires her very best compliments and regards andthousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her  . we consider our hartfield pork replied mr  . woodhouse -- indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma andcannot havegreater pleasure than -- oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us  . if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish foram sure it is us  . we may well say that our lot is cast ingoodly heritage  . well mr  . knightley and so you actually saw the letter well -- it was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful exulting of course  . -- here wassly glance at emma  . he had been so fortunate as to --forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them  . the information was as you state that he was going to be married tomiss hawkins  . by his styleshould imagine it just settled  . mr  . elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak  . he will have every bodywishes for his happiness  . he is very young to settle was mr  . woodhouseobservation  . he had better not be inhurry  . he seemed to me very well off as he was  . we were always glad to see him at hartfield  .new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates joyfully my mother is so pleased -- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage withoutmistress  . this is great news indeed  . jane you have never seen mr  . elton -- no wonder that you have suchcuriosity to see him  . janecuriosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her  . no --have never seen mr  . elton she replied starting on this appeal is he -- is hetall man who shall answer that question cried emma  . my father would say yes mr  . knightley no and miss bates andthat he is just the happy medium  . when you have been herelittle longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr  . elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind  . very true miss woodhouse so she will  . he is the very best young man -- but my dear jane if you remembertold you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr  . perry  . miss hawkins --dare say an excellent young woman  . his extreme attention to my mother -- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother islittle deaf you know -- it is not much but she does not hear quite quick  . jane says that colonel campbell islittle deaf  . he fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath -- but she says it did him no lasting benefit  . colonel campbell you know is quite our angel  . and mr  . dixon seemsvery charming young man quite worthy of him  . it is suchhappiness when good people get together -- and they always do  . now here will be mr  . elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys --suppose there never washappier orbetter couple than mr  . and mrs  . perry  .say sir turning to mr  . woodhousethink there are few places with such society as highbury  .always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours  .-- my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork --roast loin of pork -- as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her said emma nothingsuppose can be known  . one feels that it cannot bevery long acquaintance  . he has been gone only four weeks  . nobody had any information to give and afterfew more wonderings emma said you are silent miss fairfax -- buthope you mean to take an interest in this news  . you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbellaccount -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr  . elton and miss hawkins  . whenhave seen mr  . elton replied janedare sayshall be interested -- butbelieve it requires that with me  . and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may belittle worn off  . yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse said miss bates four weeks yesterday  .--miss hawkins -- wellhad always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not thatever -- mrs  . cole once whispered to me -- butimmediately said no mr  . elton ismost worthy young man -- but -- in shortdo not thinkam particularly quick at those sort of discoveries  .do not pretend to it  . what is before mesee  . at the same time nobody could wonder if mr  . elton should have aspired -- miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good - humouredly  . she knowswould not offend for the world  . how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now  . have you heard from mrs  . john knightley lately oh those dear little children  . jane do you knowalways fancy mr  . dixon like mr  . john knightley  .mean in person -- tall and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative  . quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all  . very odd but one never does formjust idea of any body beforehand  . one takes upnotion and runs away with it  . mr  . dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome handsome oh no -- far from it -- certainly plain  .told you he was plain  . my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself -- oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing  . wherehaveregardalways thinkperson well - looking  . butgave whatbelieved the general opinion whencalled him plain  . well my dear janebelieve we must be running away  . the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy  . you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave  . this has beenmost agreeable piece of news indeed  .shall just go round by mrs  . colebutshall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directly --would not have you out inshower -- we think she is the better for highbury already  . thank you we do indeed  .shall not attempt calling on mrs  . goddard forreally do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing  . good morning to you my dear sir  . oh mr  . knightley is coming too  . well that is so very --am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm  .-- mr  . elton and miss hawkins -- good morning to you  . emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in suchhurry to marry -- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject  . it was to herself an amusing andvery welcome piece of news as proving that mr  . elton could not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others  . it was now about the time that she was likely to call  . if she were to meet miss bates in her way -- and upon its beginning to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs  . goddardand that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation  . the shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which hurrying thither withfull heart was likely to give and the oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation  . as the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to tell  . she had set out from mrs  . goddardhalf an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house whereyoung woman was making upgown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay halfmoment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at ford . -- fordwas the principal woollen - draper linen - draper and haberdashershop united the shop first in size and fashion in the place  .-- and so there she had set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes perhaps -- when all ofsudden who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd -- but they always dealt at ford-- who should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother -- dear miss woodhouse only think  .thoughtshould have fainted  .did not know what to do  .was sitting near the door -- elizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella  .am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop andkept sitting near the door -- oh dearwas so miserableam suremust have been as white as my gown  .could not go away you know because of the rain butdid so wish myself anywhere in the world but there  .-- oh dear miss woodhouse -- well at lastfancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another  .am sure they were talking of me andcould not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me -- do you think he was miss woodhouse -- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me and asked me howdid and seemed ready to shake hands ifwould  . she did not do any of it in the same way that she usedcould see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time butknow no more whatsaid --was in suchtremble --remember she said she was sorry we never met now whichthought almost too kind dear miss woodhousewas absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up andwas determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think --found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke andanswered -- andstood forminute feeling dreadfully you know one cantell how and thentook courage and said it did not rain andmust go and so offset andhad not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say ifwas going to hartfield he thoughthad much better go round by mr  . colestables forshould find the near way quite floated by this rain  . oh dearthought it would have been the death of me sosaidwas very much obliged to him you knowcould not do less and then he went back to elizabeth andcame round by the stables --believedid -- buthardly knew wherewas or any thing about it  . oh miss woodhousewould rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there wassort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly  . and elizabeth too  . oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again  . very sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in her power  . she was obliged to stop and think  . she was not thoroughly comfortable herself  . the young manconduct and his sisterseemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them  . as harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour  . but she had believed them to be well - meaning worthy people before and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion it was folly to be disturbed by it  . of course he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry  . ambition as well as love had probably been mortified  . they might all have hoped to rise by harrietacquaintance and besides what was the value of harrietdescription -- so easily pleased -- so little discerning -- what signified her praise she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering all that had passed asmere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt on it might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over -- and may never -- can never asfirst meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it  . harriet said very true and she would not think about it but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else and emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head was obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at suchstate of mind in poor harriet -- suchconclusion of mr  . eltonimportance with her mr  . eltonrights however gradually revived  . though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy  . emma learned to be rather glad that there had been suchmeeting  . it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any influence to alarm  . as harriet now lived the martins could not get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her refusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs  . goddardandtwelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again with any necessity or even any power of speech  . chapter iv human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations thatyoung person who either marries or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of  .week had not passed since miss hawkinsname was first mentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind to be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable and when mr  . elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more for him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose music she principally played  . mr  . elton returnedvery happy man  . he had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed invery sanguine hope afterseries of what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing the right lady but finding himself debased to the level ofvery wrong one  . he had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior of course to the first as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost  . he came back gay and self - satisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse and defying miss smith  . the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune of so many thousands as would always be called tenpoint of some dignity as well as some convenience the story told well he had not thrown himself away -- he had gainedwoman of 10 000 . or thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs  . cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr  . greenand the party at mrs  . brown-- smiles and blushes rising in importance -- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short to usemost intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally contented  . he had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection and was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young ladies of the place to whomfew weeks ago he would have been more cautiously gallant  . the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for and when he set out for bath again there wasgeneral expectation whichcertain glance of mrs  . coledid not seem to contradict that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride  . during his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now spread over his air  . she was in fact beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that except inmoral light aspenancelessonsource of profitable humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again  . she wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction  . the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly be lessened by his marriage  . many vain solicitudes would be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it  .mrs  . elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark  . it would be almost beginning their life of civility again  . of the lady individually emma thought very little  . she was good enough for mr  . elton no doubt accomplished enough for highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain probably by harrietside  . as to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet he had done nothing  . on that article truth seemed attainable  . what she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out and setting aside the 10 000 . it did not appear that she was at all harrietsuperior  . she brought no name no blood no alliance  . miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters ofbristol -- merchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also  . part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though the father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter had lived  . emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise  . and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister who was very well married togentleman ingreat way near bristol who kept two carriages that was the wind - up of the history that was the glory of miss hawkins  . could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all she had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be talked out of it  . the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harrietmind was not to be talked away  . he might be superseded by another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer evenrobert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else she feared would cure her  . harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always in love  . and now poor girl she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr  . elton  . she was always havingglimpse of him somewhere or other  . emma saw him only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure just to meet with him or just to miss him just to hear his voice or see his shoulder just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture  . she was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when at hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr  . elton and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns and every report therefore every guess -- all that had already occurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and furniture was continually in agitation around her  . her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkinshappiness and continual observation of how much he seemed attached -- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat being all in proof of how much he was in love had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of harrietmind emma would have been amused by its variations  . sometimes mr  . elton predominated sometimes the martins and each was occasionally useful ascheck to the other  . mr  . eltonengagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr  . martin  . the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had beenlittle put aside by elizabeth martincalling at mrs  . goddarda few days afterwards  . harriet had not been at home butnote had been prepared and left for her written in the very style to touchsmall mixture of reproach withgreat deal of kindness and till mr  . elton himself appeared she had been much occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return and wishing to do more than she dared to confess  . but mr  . elton in person had driven away all such cares  . while he staid the martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return elizabeth martinvisit  . how that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what might be safest had beenpoint of some doubtful consideration  . absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would be ingratitude  . it must not be and yet the danger ofrenewal of the acquaintance -- after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harrietreturning the visit but inway that if they had understanding should convince them that it was to be onlyformal acquaintance  . she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill while she drovelittle farther and call for her again so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future  . she could think of nothing better and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude merely glossed over -- it must be done or what would become of harriet chaptersmall heart had harriet for visiting  . only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs  . goddardher evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that momenttrunk directed to the rev  . philip elton white - hart bath was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butchercart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequentlyblank  . she went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revivelittle local agitation and when they parted emma observed her to be looking around withsort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour  . she went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell  . the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and unattended by any alarming young man  . she came solitarily down the gravel walk --miss martin just appearing at the door and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility  . harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account  . she was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating  . she had seen only mrs  . martin and the two girls  . they had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last when mrs  . martinsaying all ofsudden that she thought miss smith was grown had brought onmore interesting subject andwarmer manner  . in that very room she had been measured last september with her two friends  . there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window  . he had done it  . they all seemed to remember the day the hour the party the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding and they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage reappeared and all was over  . the style of the visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive  . fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago -- emma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally harriet must suffer  . it wasbad business  . she would have givengreat deal or enduredgreat deal to have had the martins inhigher rank of life  . they were so deserving thatlittle higher should have been enough but as it was how could she have done otherwise -- impossible -- she could not repent  . they must be separated but there wasgreat deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity oflittle consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it  . her mind was quite sick of mr  . elton and the martins  . the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary  . it wasgood scheme but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both been out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield  . this is too bad cried emma as they turned away  . and now we shall just miss them too provoking --do not know whenhave been so disappointed  . and she leaned back in the corner to indulge her murmurs or to reason them away probablylittle of both -- such being the commonest process ofnot ill - disposed mind  . presently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt by mr  . and mrs  . weston who were standing to speak to her  . there was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for mr  . weston immediately accosted her with howye do -- howye do -- we have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well  . frank comes to - morrow --hadletter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time tocertainty -- he is at oxford to - day and he comes forwhole fortnightknew it would be so  . if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three dayswas always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather  . we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish  . there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the influence of suchhappy face as mr  . westonconfirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not less to the purpose  . to know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy  . it wasmost delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits  . the worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming and in the rapidity of halfmomentthought she hoped mr  . elton would now be talked of no more  . mr  . weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command as well as the route and the method of his journey and she listened and smiled and congratulated  .shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion  . emma could imagine she sawtouch of the arm at this speech from his wife  . we had better move on mr  . weston said she we are detaining the girls  . well wellam ready -- and turning again to emma but you must not be expecting suchvery fine young man you have only had my account you knowdare say he is really nothing extraordinary -- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speakingvery different conviction  . emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer inmanner that appropriated nothing  . think of me to - morrow my dear emma about fourclock was mrs  . westonparting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her  . fourclock -- depend upon it he will be here by three was mr  . westonquick amendment and so endedmost satisfactory meeting  . emmaspirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing woredifferent air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before  . when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet she saw something likelook of springtender smile even there  . will mr  . frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford -- wasquestion however which did not augur much  . but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma was now inhumour to resolve that they should both come in time  . the morning of the interesting day arrived and mrs  . westonfaithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelveclock that she was to think of her at four  . my dear dear anxious friend -- said she in mental soliloquy while walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful for every bodycomfort but your ownsee you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right  . the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall  . tis twelveshall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to - morrow perhaps orlittle latermay be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here  .am sure they will bring him soon  . she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- mr  . weston and his son  . they had been arrived onlyfew minutes and mr  . weston had scarcely finished his explanation of frankbeingday before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure  . the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually before her -- he was presented to her and she did not think too much had been said in his praise he wasvery good looking young man height air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance hadgreat deal of the spirit and liveliness of his fatherhe looked quick and sensible  . she felt immediately that she should like him and there waswell - bred ease of manner andreadiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be  . he had reached randalls the evening before  . she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain halfday  .told you yesterday cried mr  . weston with exultationtold you all that he would be here before the time named  .remembered whatused to do myself  . one cannot creep uponjourney one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon onefriends before the look - out begins is worthgreat deal more than any little exertion it needs  . it isgreat pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses thatshould presume on so far but in coming homefeltmight do any thing  . the word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency  . emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable the conviction was strengthened by what followed  . he was very much pleased with randalls thought itmost admirably arranged house would hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but oneown country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it  . that he should never have been able to indulge so amiablefeeling before passed suspiciously through emmabrain but still if it werefalsehood it waspleasant one and pleasantly handled  . his manner had no air of study or exaggeration  . he did really look and speak as if instate of no common enjoyment  . their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance  . on his side were the inquiries -- was shehorsewoman -- pleasant rides -- pleasant walks -- had theylarge neighbourhood -- highbury perhaps afforded society enough -- there were several very pretty houses in and about it  .-- balls -- had they balls -- was itmusical society but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his mother - in - law and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please -- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her  . he did not advanceword of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs  . weston but undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter  . he understood what would be welcome he could be sure of little else  . his fathermarriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it and the family from whom he had received suchblessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him  . he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylormerits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhousecharacter than miss woodhouse miss taylor . and at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person  . elegant agreeable mannerswas prepared for said he butconfess that considering every thinghad not expected more thanvery tolerably well - looking woman ofcertain agedid not know thatwas to findpretty young woman in mrs  . weston  . you cannot see too much perfection in mrs  . weston for my feelings said emma were you to guess her to be eighteenshould listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words  . donlet her imagine that you have spoken of her aspretty young woman  .hopeshould know better he replied no depend upon it withgallant bow that in addressing mrs  . westonshould understand whommight praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms  . emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance  . she must see more of him to understand his ways at present she only felt they were agreeable  . she had no doubt of what mr  . weston was often thinking about  . his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them withhappy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening  . her own fatherperfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion wasmost comfortable circumstance  . happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it  .-- though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them  . she blessed the favouring blindness  . he could now without the drawback ofsingle unpleasant surmise withoutglance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr  . frank churchillaccommodation on his journey through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night  .reasonable visit paid mr  . weston began to move  .-- he must be going  . he had business at the crown about his hay andgreat many errands for mrs  . weston at fordbut he need not hurry any body else  . his son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying as you are going farther on business sirwill take the opportunity of payingvisit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now  .have the honour of being acquainted withneighbour of yours turning to emmalady residing in or near highburyfamily of the name of fairfax  .shall have no difficultysuppose in finding the house though fairfaxbelieve is not the proper name --should rather say barnes or bates  . do you know any family of that name to be sure we do cried his father mrs  . bates -- we passed her house --saw miss bates at the window  . true true you are acquainted with miss fairfaxremember you knew her at weymouth andfine girl she is  . call upon her by all means  . there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which -- oh go to - day go to - day  . do not defer it  . what is right to be done cannot be done too soon  . and besidesmust give youhint frank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided  . you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is withpoor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on  . if you do not call early it will beslight  . the son looked convinced  .have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she isvery elegant young woman  . he agreed to it but with so quietyes as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must bevery distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it  . if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said shethink you will to - day  . you will see her to advantage see her and hear her -- noam afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue  . you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you said mr  . woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find hervery agreeable young lady  . she is staying here onvisit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy peoplehave known them all my life  . they will be extremely glad to see youam sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way  . my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me  . but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there aregreat many houses you might be very much atloss and it isvery dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street  . mr  . frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knowspuddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs  . bateshe may get there from the crown inhop step and jump  . they were permitted to go alone and withcordial nod from one andgraceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave  . emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort  . chapter vi the next morning brought mr  . frank churchill again  . he came with mrs  . weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially  . he had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse their walk immediately fixed on highbury  .-- he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always chuse the same  . highbury that airy cheerful happy - looking highbury would be his constant attraction  . -- highbury with mrs  . weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him  . they walked thither directly  . emma had hardly expected them for mr  . weston who had called in for halfminute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm  . she was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in company with mrs  . weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend  . if he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it  . but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied  . it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her asfriend and securing her affection  . and there was time enough for emma to formreasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning  . they were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury  . he was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr  . woodhouseear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed  . some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings  . he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and which had been the home of his fatherfather and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they shewed altogethergood - will towards highbury in general which must be very likemerit to those he was with  . emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he had not been actingpart or makingparade of insincere professions and that mr  . knightley certainly had not done him justice  . their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house though the principal one of the sort wherecouple of pair of post - horses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built many years ago forball - room and while the neighbourhood had been inparticularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used as such -- but such brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodatewhist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place  . he was immediately interested  . its character asball - room caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased  . he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested  . no it was long enough broad enough handsome enough  . it would hold the very number for comfort  . they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter  . why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room -- she who could do any thing in highbury the want of proper families in the place and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied  . he could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him could not furnish numbers enough for suchmeeting and even when particulars were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of suchmixture would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every bodyreturning into their proper place the next morning  . he argued likeyoung man very much bent on dancing and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills  . he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe  . of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference toconfusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind  . he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap  . it was but an effusion of lively spirits  . at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged emma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had paid it  . yes oh yes -- he repliedwas just going to mention it  .very successful visit --saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint  . if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me  . as it waswas only betrayed into payingmost unreasonable visit  . ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper andhad told my fathershould certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishmentfound when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last thathad been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour  . the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before  . and how did you think miss fairfax looking ill very ill -- that is ifyoung lady can ever be allowed to look ill  . but the expression is hardly admissible mrs  . weston is it ladies can never look ill  . and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health  .--most deplorable want of complexion  . emma would not agree to this and beganwarm defence of miss fairfaxcomplexion  . it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to havesickly hue in general and there wassoftness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face  . he listened with all due deference acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health  . where features were indifferentfine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was  . well said emma there is no disputing about taste  .-- at least you admire her except her complexion  . he shook his head and laughed  .--cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion  . did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society at this moment they were approaching fordand he hastily exclaimed ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me  . he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford . if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in thatmay prove myself to belong to the place to betrue citizen of highbury  .must buy something at ford . it will be taking out my freedom  .--dare say they sell gloves  . oh yes gloves and every thing  .do admire your patriotism  . you will be adored in highbury  . you were very popular before you came because you were mr  . westonson -- but lay out halfguinea at fordand your popularity will stand upon your own virtues  . they went in and while the sleek well - tied parcels of menbeavers and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he said -- butbeg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae  . do not let me lose it  .assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life  .merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth  . and now thatunderstand your questionmust pronounce it to bevery unfair one  . it is always the ladyright to decide on the degree of acquaintance  . miss fairfax must already have given her account  .--shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow  . upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself  . but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body thatreally think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her  . mayindeed -- thenwill speak the truth and nothing suits me so well  .met her frequently at weymouth  .had known the campbellslittle in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set  . colonel campbell isvery agreeable man and mrs  . campbellfriendly warm - hearted woman  .like them all  . you know miss fairfaxsituation in lifeconclude what she is destined to be yes -- rather hesitatingly --believedo  . you get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs  . weston smiling remember thatam here  .-- mr  . frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfaxsituation in life  .will movelittle farther off  .certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend  . he looked as if he fully understood and honoured suchsentiment  . when the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play said frank churchill  . ever hear her repeated emma  . you forget how much she belongs to highbury  .have heard her every year of our lives since we both began  . she plays charmingly  . you think so do you --wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge  . she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste butknow nothing of the matter myself  .--am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any bodyperformance  .--have been used to hear heradmired andremember one proof of her being thought to play well --manvery musical man and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other  . thatthought inman of known musical talent was some proof  . proof indeed said emma highly amused  .-- mr  . dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in halfyear  . yes mr  . dixon and miss campbell were the persons andthought itvery strong proof  . certainly -- very strong it was to own the truthgreat deal stronger than ifhad been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me  .could not excusemanhaving more music than love -- more ear than eye --more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings  . how did miss campbell appear to like it it was her very particular friend you know  . poor comfort said emma laughing  . one would rather havestranger preferred than onevery particular friend -- withstranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of havingvery particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself -- poor mrs  . dixon wellam glad she is gone to settle in ireland  . you are right  . it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it  . so much the better -- or so much the worse --do not know which  . but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling -- there was one personthink who must have felt it miss fairfax herself  . she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction  . as to that --do not -- oh do not imagine thatexpect an account of miss fairfaxsensations from you or from any body else  . they are known to no human beingguess but herself  . but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr  . dixon one may guess what one chuses  . there appeared suchperfectly good understanding among them all -- he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were -- how it might all be behind the scenes  .can only say that there was smoothness outwardly  . but you who have known miss fairfax fromchild must bebetter judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations thancan be  .have known her fromchild undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate -- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends  . but we never did  .hardly know how it has happenedlittle perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towardsgirl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set  . and then her reserve --never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved  . it ismost repulsive quality indeed said he  . oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing  . there is safety in reserve but no attraction  . one cannot lovereserved person  . not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater  . butmust be more in want offriend or an agreeable companion thanhave yet been to take the trouble of conquering any bodyreserve to procure one  . intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question  .have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner suchdread of givingdistinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal  . he perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting  . he was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected  . his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer  . she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr  . eltonhouse which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with  . no he could not believe itbad house not suchhouse asman was to be pitied for having  . if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house  . there must be ample room in it for every real comfort  . the man must beblockhead who wanted more  . mrs  . weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about  . used only tolarge house himself and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging tosmall one  . but emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking about and that he shewedvery amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives  . he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeperroom orbad butlerpantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment  . chapter vii emmavery good opinion of frank churchill waslittle shaken the following day by hearing that he was gone off to london merely to have his hair cut  .sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and he had sent forchaise and set off intending to return to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut  . there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve  . it did not accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday  . vanity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs  . weston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became liable to all these charges  . his father only called himcoxcomb and thought itvery good story but that mrs  . weston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young people would have their little whims  . with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him  . mrs  . weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasantcompanion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether  . he appeared to havevery open temper -- certainlyvery cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notionsgreat deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect  . this was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him the honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near it and saved only by her own indifference -- for still her resolution held of never marrying -- the honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance  . mr  . weston on his side addedvirtue to the account which must have some weight  . he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him harshly  . as mrs  . weston observed all young people would have their little whims  . there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so leniently disposed  . in general he was judged throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of suchhandsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit among them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows or smiles -- mr  . knightley  . the circumstance was told him at hartfield for the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself overnewspaper he held in his hand hum just the trifling silly fellowtook him for  . she had halfmind to resent but an instantobservation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass  . although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings mr  . and mrs  . westonvisit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune  . something occurred while they were at hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave  . this was the occurrence -- the coles had been settled some years in highbury and were very good sort of people -- friendly liberal and unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade and only moderately genteel  . on their first coming into the country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last year or two had brought themconsiderable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them  . with their wealth their views increased their want oflarger house their inclination for more company  . they added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield  . their love of society and their new dining - room prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company andfew parties chiefly among the single men had already taken place  . the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls  . nothing should tempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her fatherknown habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish  . the coles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them  . this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from herself she had little hope of mr  . knightley none of mr  . weston  . but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her very differently affected  . donwell and randalls had received their invitation and none had come for her father and herself and mrs  . westonaccounting for it withsuppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out was not quite sufficient  . she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept  . harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses  . they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence  . might not the evening end indance had beenquestion of his  . the bare possibility of it acted asfarther irritation on her spirits and her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be intended ascompliment was but poor comfort  . it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful  . she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely without inclination for the party  . the coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father  . they would have solicited the honour earlier but had been waiting the arrival offolding - screen from london which they hoped might keep mr  . woodhouse from any draught of air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company  . upon the whole she was very persuadable and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly mrs  . goddard if not mrs  . bates might be depended on for bearing him company -- mr  . woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughtergoing out to dinner onday now near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him  . as for his going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late and the party too numerous  . he was soon pretty well resigned  .am not fond of dinner - visiting said he --never was  . no more is emma  . late hours do not agree with us  .am sorry mr  . and mrs  . cole should have done it  .think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening  . the dews ofsummer evening are whatwould not expose any body to  . however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr  . knightley too to take care of hercannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy  . then turning to mrs  . weston withlook of gentle reproach -- ah miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me  . well sir cried mr  . weston astook miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place ifcan andwill step to mrs  . goddard inmoment if you wish it  . but the idea of any thing to be done inmoment was increasing not lessening mr  . woodhouseagitation  . the ladies knew better how to allay it  . mr  . weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately arranged  . with this treatment mr  . woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual  . he should be happy to see mrs  . goddard  . he hadgreat regard for mrs  . goddard and emma should writeline and invite her  . james could take the note  . but first of all there must be an answer written to mrs  . cole  . you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible  . you will say thatam quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments of course  . but you will do every thing right  .need not tell you what is to be done  . we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday  .shall have no fears for you with him  . we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but stillhave no doubt that james will take you very safely  . and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour  . you will not like staying late  . you will get very tired when tea is over  . but you would not wish me to come away befoream tired papa oh no my love but you will soon be tired  . there will begreat many people talking at once  . you will not like the noise  . but my dear sir cried mr  . weston if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party  . and no great harm if it does said mr  . woodhouse  . the sooner every party breaks up the better  . but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles  . emmagoing away directly after tea might be giving offence  . they are good - natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any bodyhurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhousedoing it would be more thought of than any other personin the room  . you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the colesam sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years  . no upon no account in the world mr  . westonam much obliged to you for reminding me  .should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain  .know what worthy people they are  . perry tells me that mr  . cole never touches malt liquor  . you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious -- mr  . cole is very bilious  . nowould not be the means of giving them any pain  . my dear emma we must consider this  .am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr  . and mrs  . cole you would staylittle longer than you might wish  . you will not regard being tired  . you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends  . oh yes papa  .have no fears at all for myself andshould have no scruples of staying as late as mrs  . weston but on your account  .am only afraid of your sitting up for me  .am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs  . goddard  . she loves piquet you know but when she is gone homeam afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort  . you must promise me not to sit up  . he did on the condition of some promises on her side such as that if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly if hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid should sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house as usual  . chapter viii frank churchill came back again and if he kept his fatherdinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs  . weston was too anxious for his beingfavourite with mr  . woodhouse to betray any imperfection which could be concealed  . he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself withvery good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done  . he had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits  . he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself --do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way  . wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly  .-- it depends upon the character of those who handle it  . mr  . knightley he is nottrifling silly young man  . if he were he would have done this differently  . he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it  . there would have been either the ostentation ofcoxcomb or the evasions ofmind too weak to defend its own vanities  .-- noam perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly  . with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and forlonger time than hitherto of judging of his general manners and by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were now seeing them together for the first time  . she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at mr  . coleand without being able to forget that among the failings of mr  . elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr  . cole  . her fathercomfort was amply secured mrs  . bates as well as mrs  . goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty before she left the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal  .-- she had providedplentiful dinner for them she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it  . she followed another carriage to mr  . coledoor and was pleased to see that it was mr  . knightleyfor mr  . knightley keeping no horses having little spare money andgreat deal of health activity and independence was too apt in emmaopinion to get about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey  . she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out  . this is coming as you should do said she likegentleman  .--am quite glad to see you  . he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing - roomdoubt whether you would have discerned me to be more ofgentleman than usual  .-- you might not have distinguished howcame by my look or manner  . yesshouldam sureshould  . there is alwayslook of consciousness or bustle when people come inway which they know to be beneath them  . you think you carry it off very welldare say but with you it issort of bravado an air of affected unconcernalways observe it whenevermeet you under those circumstances  . now you have nothing to try for  . you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed  . you are not striving to look taller than any body else  . nowshall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you  . nonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger  . emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr  . knightley  . she was received withcordial respect which could not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for  . when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her withcheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side  . the party was rather large as it included one other familyproper unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr  . coxfamily the lawyer of highbury  . the less worthy females were to come in the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and mr  . elton were talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour  . the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax  . mrs  . cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting  . she listened and found it well worth listening to  . that very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply  . mrs  . cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight ofpianoforte --very elegant looking instrument -- notgrand butlarge - sized square pianoforte and the substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations on miss bateswas that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwoodthe day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected that at first by miss batesaccount jane herself was quite atloss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter -- of course it must be from colonel campbell  . one can suppose nothing else added mrs  . cole andwas only surprized that there could ever have beendoubt  . but jane it seems hadletter from them very lately and notword was said about it  . she knows their ways best butshould not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present  . they might chuse to surprize her  . mrs  . cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell and equally rejoiced that suchpresent had been made and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way and still listen to mrs  . cole  .declaredo not know whenhave heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction -- it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument  . it seemed quiteshame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away  . this is like giving ourselvesslap to be sure and it was but yesterdaywas telling mr  . colereally was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room whiledo not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with  .--was saying this to mr  . cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it tobetter use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or elseam sure we ought to be ashamed of it  .-- we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening  . miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs  . coleturned to frank churchill  . why do you smile said she  . nay why do you me --supposesmile for pleasure at colonel campbellbeing so rich and so liberal  .-- it ishandsome present  . very  .rather wonder that it was never made before  . perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before  . or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body  . that isgrand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs  . bateshouse  . you may say what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine  .do not know  .rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness thandeserve  .smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whateverfind you suspect but at presentdo not see what there is to question  . if colonel campbell is not the person who can be what do you say to mrs  . dixon mrs  . dixon very true indeed  .had not thought of mrs  . dixon  . she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more likeyoung womanscheme than an elderly man . it is mrs  . dixondare say  .told you that your suspicions would guide mine  . if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr  . dixon in them  . mr  . dixon  .-- very well  . yesimmediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr  . and mrs  . dixon  . we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance  . yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea whichhad entertained before  .--do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr  . dixon or miss fairfax butcannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious oflittle attachment on her side  . one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right butam sure there must beparticular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland  . here she must be leadinglife of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment  . as to the pretence of trying her native airlook upon that asmere excuse  .-- in the summer it might have passed but what can any bodynative air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health anddare say in her .do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so nobleprofession of doing it buthonestly tell you what they are  . and upon my word they have an air of great probability  . mr  . dixonpreference of her music to her friendi can answer for being very decided  . and then he saved her life  . did you ever hear of that --water party and by some accident she was falling overboard  . he caught her  . he did  .was there -- one of the party  . were you really -- well -- but you observed nothing of course for it seems to benew idea to you  .-- ifhad been therethinkshould have made some discoveries  .dare say you would butsimplesaw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr  . dixon caught her  .-- it was the work ofmoment  . and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeedbelieve it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too generalsensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable  .do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries  . the conversation was here interrupted  . they were called on to share in the awkwardness ofrather long interval between the courses and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me  .wanted to knowlittle more and this tells me quite enough  . depend upon it we shall soon hear that it ispresent from mr  . and mrs  . dixon  . and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells  . noam sure it is not from the campbells  . miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first  . she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them  .may not have convinced you perhaps butam perfectly convinced myself that mr  . dixon isprincipal in the business  . indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced  . your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely  . at first whilesupposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giversaw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world  . but when you mentioned mrs  . dixonfelt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship  . and nowcan see it in no other light than as an offering of love  . there was no occasion to press the matter farther  . the conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it  . she said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversationfew clever things saidfew downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes  . the ladies had not been long in the drawing - room before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived  . emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection  . there she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding to be in company nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour  . jane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes of having loved even mr  . elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend  . in so largeparty it was not necessary that emma should approach her  . she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair and therefore purposely kept atdistance but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend colonel campbell  . mrs  . weston kind - hearted and musical was particularly interested by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the fair heroinecountenance  . they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the early was frank churchill  . in he walked the first and the handsomest and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle where sat miss woodhouse and till he could findseat by her would not sit at all  . emma divined what every body present must be thinking  . she was his object and every body must perceive it  . she introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other  . he had never seen so lovelyface and was delighted with her naivete  . and she only to be sure it was paying him too greatcompliment but she did think there were some lookslittle like mr  . elton  . emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence  . smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech  . he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room -- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could -- that his father mr  . knightley mr  . cox and mr  . cole were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in generalset of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families -- that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much  . she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were amongrange of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that mrs  . churchill were not in health and spirits for going that they madepoint of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance fornight  . she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at its best might reasonably pleaseyoung man who had more retirement at home than he liked  . his importance at enscombe was very evident  . he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing  . one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned  . he had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it  . this had happened the year before  . now he said he was beginning to have no longer the same wish  . the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father  .have mademost wretched discovery said he aftershort pause  .--have been hereweek to - morrow -- half my time  .never knew days fly so fast  .week to - morrow -- andhave hardly begun to enjoy myself  . but just got acquainted with mrs  . weston and others --hate the recollection  . perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut  . no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all  .have no pleasure in seeing my friends unlesscan believe myself fit to be seen  . the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself obliged to turn from him forfew minutes and listen to mr  . cole  . when mr  . cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite  . what is the matter said she  . he started  . thank you for rousing me he replied  .believehave been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so oddway -- so very oddway -- thatcannot keep my eyes from her  .never saw any thing so outree -- those curls -- this must befancy of her own  .see nobody else looking like her --must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion  . shall-- yeswill --declarewill -- and you shall see how she takes it -- whether she colours  . he was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing  . before he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs  . weston  . this is the luxury oflarge party said she -- one can get near every body and say every thing  . my dear emmaam longing to talk to you  .have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself andmust tell them while the idea is fresh  . do you know how miss bates and her niece came here how -- they were invited were not they oh yes -- but how they were conveyed hither -- the manner of their coming they walkedconclude  . how else could they come very true  .-- welllittle while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now  . and aslooked at her thoughnever saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold  . poor girlcould not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr  . weston came into the room andcould get at himspoke to him about the carriage  . you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbationmade my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home forthought it would be making her comfortable at once  . good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure  . nobody was ever so fortunate as herself -- but with many many thanks -- there was no occasion to trouble us for mr  . knightleycarriage had brought and was to take them home again  .was quite surprized -- very gladam sure but really quite surprized  . suchvery kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention -- the sort of thing that so few men would think of  . and in short from knowing his usual waysam very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all  .do suspect he would not have hadpair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them  . very likely said emma -- nothing more likely  .know no man more likely than mr  . knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured useful considerate or benevolent  . he is notgallant man but he isvery humane one and this considering jane fairfaxill - health would appearcase of humanity to him -- and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whomwould fix on more than on mr  . knightley  .know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together andlaughed at him about it but he said notword that could betray  . well said mrs  . weston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance thando for while miss bates was speakingsuspicion darted into my head andhave never been able to get it out again  . the morethink of it the more probable it appears  . in shorthave madematch between mr  . knightley and jane fairfax  . see the consequence of keeping you company -- what do you say to it mr  . knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma  . dear mrs  . weston how could you think of suchthing -- mr  . knightley -- mr  . knightley must not marry -- you would not have little henry cut out from donwell -- oh no no henry must have donwell  .cannot at all consent to mr  . knightleymarrying andam sure it is not at all likely  .am amazed that you should think of suchthing  . my dear emmahave told you what led me to think of it  .do not want the match --do not want to injure dear little henry -- but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr  . knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henryaccountboy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter yeswould  .could not bear to have henry supplanted  .-- mr  . knightley marry -- nohave never had such an idea andcannot adopt it now  . and jane fairfax too of all women nay she has always beenfirst favourite with him as you very well know  . but the imprudence of suchmatcham not speaking of its prudence merely its probability  .see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention  . his good - nature his humanity astell you would be quite enough to account for the horses  . he hasgreat regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention  . my dear mrs  . weston do not take to match - making  . you do it very ill  . jane fairfax mistress of the abbey -- oh no no -- every feeling revolts  . for his own sakewould not have him do so madthing  . imprudent if you please -- but not mad  . excepting inequality of fortune and perhapslittle disparity of agecan see nothing unsuitable  . but mr  . knightley does not want to marry  .am sure he has not the least idea of it  . do not put it into his head  . why should he marry -- he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brotherchildren  . he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart  . my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax -- nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax  . in the way of loveam sure he does not  . he would do any good to her or her family but -- well said mrs  . weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane suchrespectable home  . if it would be good to heram sure it would be evil to himselfvery shameful and degrading connexion  . how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him -- to have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane -- so very kind and obliging -- but he always had been suchvery kind neighbour and then fly off through halfsentence to her motherold petticoat  . not that it was suchvery old petticoat either -- for still it would lastgreat while -- and indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong  . for shame emma do not mimic her  . you divert me against my conscience  . and upon my worddo not think mr  . knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates  . little things do not irritate him  . she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice  . but the question is not whether it would bebad connexion for him but whether he wishes it andthink he does  .have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her -- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospecthave heard him express himself so warmly on those points -- such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voicehave heard him say that he could listen to her for ever  . oh andhad almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider itpresent from the campbells may it not be from mr  . knightleycannot help suspecting him  .think he is just the person to do it even without being in love  . then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love  . butdo not think it is at alllikely thing for him to do  . mr  . knightley does nothing mysteriously  .have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener thanshould suppose suchcircumstance would in the common course of things occur to him  . very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so  . there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma  .havevery strong notion that it comes from him  .am sure he was particularly silent when mrs  . cole told us of it at dinner  . you take up an idea mrs  . weston and run away with it as you have manytime reproached me with doing  .see no sign of attachment --believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that mr  . knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax  . they combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs  . weston was the most used of the two to yield tilllittle bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation -- and at the same moment mr  . cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it  . frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs  . weston she had been seeing nothing except that he had foundseat by miss fairfax followed mr  . cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited emma best to lead she gavevery proper compliance  . she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany her own voice well  . one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize --second slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill  . her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed  . he was accused of havingdelightful voice andperfect knowledge of music which was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted  . they sang together once more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own  . with mixed feelings she seated herself atlittle distance from the numbers round the instrument to listen  . frank churchill sang again  . they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth  . but the sight of mr  . knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half emmamind and she fell intotrain of thinking on the subject of mrs  . westonsuspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions  . her objections to mr  . knightleymarrying did not in the least subside  . she could see nothing but evil in it  . it would begreat disappointment to mr  . john knightley consequently to isabella  .real injury to the children --most mortifying change and material loss to them all --very great deduction from her fatherdaily comfort -- and as to herself she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey  .mrs  . knightley for them all to give way to -- no -- mr  . knightley must never marry  . little henry must remain the heir of donwell  . presently mr  . knightley looked back and came and sat down by her  . they talked at first only of the performance  . his admiration was certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs  . weston it would not have struck her  . assort of touchstone however she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own  .often feel concern said she thatdare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions  . it is not thatam without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put - to for suchpurpose  . quite out of the question quite out of the question he replied -- but you must often wish itam sure  . and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step  . this present from the campbells said she -- this pianoforte is very kindly given  . yes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment  .-- but they would have done better had they given her notice of it  . surprizes are foolish things  . the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable  .should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell  . from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr  . knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument  . but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remainedlittle longer doubtful  . towards the end of janesecond song her voice grew thick  . that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud -- you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet  . another song however was soon begged for  . one more -- they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more  . and frank churchill was heard to saythink you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling  . the strength of the song falls on the second  . mr  . knightley grew angry  . that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice  . this must not be  . and touching miss bates who at that moment passed near -- miss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere  . they have no mercy on her  . miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing  . here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by mr  . and mrs  . cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space  . mrs  . weston capital in her country - dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top  . while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr  . knightley  . this would betrial  . he was no dancer in general  . if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something  . there was no immediate appearance  . no he was talking to mrs  . cole -- he was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else and he was still talking to mrs  . cole  . emma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment  . not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched inpartner  . they werecouple worth looking at  . two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed  . it was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home on her motheraccount  . after some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs  . weston look sorrowful and have done  . perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma to her carriage  .must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after your . chapter ix emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles  . the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity  . she must have delighted the coles -- worthy people who deserved to be made happy -- and leftname behind her that would not soon die away  . perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy  . she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfaxfeelings to frank churchill  . it was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told wascompliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue  . the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax and there she had no doubt  . she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing  . she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour andhalf  . she was then interrupted by harrietcoming in and if harrietpraise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted  . oh ifcould but play as well as you and miss fairfax donclass us together harriet  . my playing is no more like herthanlamp is like sunshine  . oh dear --think you play the best of the two  .think you play quite as well as she does  .am surehad much rather hear you  . every body last night said how well you played  . those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference  . the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfaxis much beyond it  . wellalways shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out  . mr  . cole said how much taste you had and mr  . frank churchill talkedgreat deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution  . ah but jane fairfax has them both harriet  . are you suresaw she had execution butdid not know she had any taste  . nobody talked about it  . andhate italian singing  .-- there is no understandingword of it  . besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach  . the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family  . how did you think the coxes looked just as they always do -- very vulgar  . they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence  . emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its producing mr  . elton  . they told me -- that mr  . martin dined with them last saturday  . oh he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner  . oh they talkedgreat deal about him especially anne cox  .do not know what she meant but she asked me ifthoughtshould go and stay there again next summer  . she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be  . she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there  . he sat by her at dinner  . miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him  . very likely  .--think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury  . harriet had business at ford .-- emma thought it most prudent to go with her  . another accidental meeting with the martins was possible and in her present state would be dangerous  . harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by halfword was always very long atpurchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement  .-- much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury -- mr  . perry walking hastily by mr  . william cox letting himself in at the office - door mr  . colecarriage - horses returning from exercise orstray letter - boy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his traytidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling overdirty bone andstring of dawdling children round the bakerlittle bow - window eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door  .mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer  . she looked down the randalls road  . the scene enlarged two persons appeared mrs  . weston and her son - in - law they were walking into highbury -- to hartfield of course  . they were stopping however in the first place at mrs  . bateswhose house waslittle nearer randalls than fordand had all but knocked when emma caught their eye  .-- immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterdayengagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting  . mrs  . weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument  . for my companion tells me said she thatabsolutely promised miss bates last night thatwould come this morning  .was not aware of it myself  .did not know thathad fixedday but as he saysdidam going now  . and while mrs  . weston pays her visitmay be allowedhope said frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfield -- if you are going home  . mrs  . weston was disappointed  .thought you meant to go with me  . they would be very much pleased  . meshould be quite in the way  . but perhaps --may be equally in the way here  . miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me  . my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping  . she saysfidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same  . what amto doam here on no business of my own said emmaam only waiting for my friend  . she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home  . but you had better go with mrs  . weston and hear the instrument  . well -- if you advise it  .-- but withsmile if colonel campbell should have employedcareless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shallsayshall be no support to mrs  . weston  . she might do very well by herself  .disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips butam the wretchedest being in the world atcivil falsehood  .do not believe any such thing replied emma  .--am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent  . quite otherwise indeed ifunderstood miss fairfaxopinion last night  . do come with me said mrs  . weston if it be not very disagreeable to you  . it need not detain us long  . we will go to hartfield afterwards  . we will follow them to hartfield  .really wish you to call with me  . it will be felt so great an attention andalways thought you meant it  . he could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him returned with mrs  . weston to mrs  . batesdoor  . emma watched them in and then joined harriet at the interesting counter -- trying with all the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured and thatblue ribbon be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern  . at last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel  . shouldsend it to mrs  . goddardma am asked mrs  . ford  .-- yes -- no -- yes to mrs  . goddard . only my pattern gown is at hartfield  . no you shall send it to hartfield if you please  . but then mrs  . goddard will want to see it  .-- andcould take the pattern gown home any day  . butshall want the ribbon directly -- so it had better go to hartfield -- at least the ribbon  . you could make it into two parcels mrs  . ford could not you it is not worth while harriet to give mrs  . ford the trouble of two parcels  . no more it is  . no trouble in the world ma am said the obliging mrs  . ford  . oh but indeedwould much rather have it only in one  . then if you please you shall send it all to mrs  . goddard--do not know -- nothink miss woodhousemay just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night  . what do you advise that you do not give another half - second to the subject  . to hartfield if you please mrs  . ford  . aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfiedshould not at all like to have it sent to mrs  . goddard . voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies mrs  . weston and miss bates met them at the door  . my dear miss woodhouse said the latteram just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with uslittle while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith  . how do you do miss smith -- very wellthank you  .-- andbegged mrs  . weston to come with me thatmight be sure of succeeding  .hope mrs  . bates and miss fairfax are -- very wellam much obliged to you  . my mother is delightfully well and jane caught no cold last night  . how is mr  . woodhouse --am so glad to hear suchgood account  . mrs  . weston told me you were here  .-- oh then saidi must run acrossam sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are suchnice party she cannot refuse  .-- aye pray do said mr  . frank churchill miss woodhouseopinion of the instrument will be worth having  . -- but saidi shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me  .-- oh said he wait halfminute tillhave finished my job -- for would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my motherspectacles  .-- the rivet came out you know this morning  .-- so very obliging -- for my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on  . and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed  . jane said so  .meant to take them over to john saunders the first thingdid but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know  . at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping  . oh saidpatty do not come with your bad news to me  . here is the rivet of your mistressspectacles out  . then the baked apples came home mrs  . wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the wallises always --have heard some people say that mrs  . wallis can be uncivil and givevery rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them  . and it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know only three of us  .-- besides dear jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes suchshocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it  .dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- sosay one thing and thensay another and it passes off  . but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome fortook the opportunity the other day of asking mr  . perryhappened to meet him in the street  . not thathad any doubt before --have so often heard mr  . woodhouse recommendbaked apple  .believe it is the only way that mr  . woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome  . we have apple - dumplings however very often  . patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling  . well mrs  . weston you have prevailedhope and these ladies will oblige us  . emma would be very happy to wait on mrs  . bates . and they did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than how do you do mrs  . fordbeg your pardon  .did not see you before  .hear you havecharming collection of new ribbons from town  . jane came back delighted yesterday  . thank ye the gloves do very well -- onlylittle too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in  . what wastalking of said she beginning again when they were all in the street  . emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix  .declarecannot recollect whatwas talking of  .-- oh my motherspectacles  . so very obliging of mr  . frank churchill oh said hedo thinkcan fasten the rivetlikejob of this kind excessively  . -- which you know shewed him to be so very  .  .  .  . indeedmust say that much ashad heard of him before and much ashad expected he very far exceeds any thing  .  .  .  .do congratulate you mrs  . weston most warmly  . he seems every thing the fondest parent could  .  .  .  . oh said hecan fasten the rivet  .likejob of that sort excessively  .never shall forget his manner  . and whenbrought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finest - looking home - baked applesever saw in my life  . that you know was so very  .  .  .  . andam sure by his manner it was no compliment  . indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs  . wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr  . woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it  . the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyonddoubt all from donwell -- some of mr  . knightleymost liberal supply  . he sends ussack every year and certainly there never was suchkeeping apple anywhere as one of his trees --believe there is two of them  . my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days  . butwas really quite shocked the other day -- for mr  . knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock  .am sure you must be said he andwill send you another supply forhavegreat many more thancan ever use  . william larkins let me keeplarger quantity than usual this year  .will send you some more before they get good for nothing  . sobegged he would not -- for really as to ours being gonecould not absolutely say that we hadgreat many left -- it was but halfdozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane andcould not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same  . and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me -- noshould not say quarrelled for we never hadquarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed thathad owned the apples were so nearly gone she wishedhad made him believe we hadgreat many left  . oh saidmy deardid say as much ascould  . however the very same evening william larkins came over withlarge basket of apples the same sort of applesbushel at least andwas very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose  . william larkins is such an old acquaintanceam always glad to see him  . but howeverfound afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil  . william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his masterprofit than any thing but mrs  . hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away  . she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring  . he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs  . hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder  . and so patty told me andwas excessively shocked indeedwould not have mr  . knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very  .  .  .  .wanted to keep it from janeknowledge but unluckilyhad mentioned it beforewas aware  . miss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will  . pray take care mrs  . weston there isstep at the turning  . pray take care miss woodhouse ours is ratherdark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish  . miss smith pray take care  . miss woodhouseam quite concernedam sure you hit your foot  . miss smith the step at the turning  . chapterthe appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered was tranquillity itself mrs  . bates deprived of her usual employment slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill attable near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte  . busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shewmost happy countenance on seeing emma again  . this ispleasure said he in ratherlow voice coming at least ten minutes earlier thanhad calculated  . you find me trying to be useful tell me if you thinkshall succeed  . what said mrs  . weston have not you finished it yet you would not earnvery good livelihood asworking silversmith at this rate  .have not been working uninterruptedly he repliedhave been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floorbelieve  . you see we have been wedging one leg with paper  . this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come  .was almost afraid you would be hurrying home  . he contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again  . that she was not immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again  . at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to  . mrs  . weston had been delighted before and was delighted again emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise  . whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill withsmile at emma the person has not chosen ill  .heardgood deal of colonel campbelltaste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notesam sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize  .dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself  . do not you think so jane did not look round  . she was not obliged to hear  . mrs  . weston had been speaking to her at the same moment  . it is not fair said emma inwhisper mine wasrandom guess  . do not distress her  . he shook his head withsmile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy  . soon afterwards he began again how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax  .dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrumentcoming to hand  . do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time -- do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent onlygeneral direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences he paused  . she could not but hear she could not avoid answering tillhaveletter from colonel campbell said she invoice of forced calmnesscan imagine nothing with any confidence  . it must be all conjecture  . conjecture -- aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong  .wishcould conjecture how soonshall make this rivet quite firm  . what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all -- your real workmensuppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold ofword -- miss fairfax said something about conjecturing  . there it is done  .have the pleasure madam to mrs  . bates of restoring your spectacles healed for the present  . he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escapelittle from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more  . if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night -- let me live them over again  . you did not enjoy them asdid you appeared tired the whole time  .believe you were glad we danced no longer butwould have given worlds -- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour  . she played  . what felicity it is to heartune again which has made one happy -- ifmistake not that was danced at weymouth  . she looked up at him formoment coloured deeply and played something else  . he took some music fromchair near the pianoforte and turning to emma said here is something quite new to me  . do you know it -- cramer  .-- and here arenew set of irish melodies  . that from suchquarter one might expect  . this was all sent with the instrument  . very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it -- he knew miss fairfax could have no music here  .honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart  . nothing hastily done nothing incomplete  . true affection only could have prompted it  . emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains ofsmile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had beensmile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her  .-- this amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings  . he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together  .-- emma took the opportunity of whispering you speak too plain  . she must understand you  .hope she does  .would have her understand me  .am not in the least ashamed of my meaning  . but reallyam half ashamed and wishhad never taken up the idea  .am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me  .have nowkey to all her odd looks and ways  . leave shame to her  . if she does wrong she ought to feel it  . she is not entirely without itthink  .do not see much sign of it  . she is playing robin adair at this moment -- his favourite  . shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried mr  . knightley on horse - back not far off  . mr  . knightleydeclare --must speak to him if possible just to thank him  .will not open the window here it would give you all cold butcan go into my motherroom you know  .dare say he will come in when he knows who is here  . quite delightful to have you all meet so -- our little room so honoured she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called mr  . knightleyattention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment  . howye do -- howye do -- very wellthank you  . so obliged to you for the carriage last night  . we were just in time my mother just ready for us  . pray come in do come in  . you will find some friends here  . so began miss bates and mr  . knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say how is your niece miss bates --want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece  . how is miss fairfax --hope she caught no cold last night  . how is she to - day tell me how miss fairfax is  . and miss bates was obliged to givedirect answer before he would hear her in any thing else  . the listeners were amused and mrs  . weston gave emmalook of particular meaning  . but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism  . so obliged to you -- so very much obliged to you for the carriage resumed miss bates  . he cut her short witham going to kingston  . cando any thing for you oh dear kingston -- are you -- mrs  . cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston  . mrs  . cole has servants to send  . cando any thing for you nothank you  . but do come in  . who do you think is here -- miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte  . do put up your horse at the crown and come in  . well said he indeliberating manner for five minutes perhaps  . and here is mrs  . weston and mr  . frank churchill too -- quite delightful so many friends no not nowthank you  .could not stay two minutes  .must get on to kingston as fast ascan  . oh do come in  . they will be so very happy to see you  . no no your room is full enough  .will call another day and hear the pianoforte  . wellam so sorry -- oh mr  . knightley whatdelightful party last night how extremely pleasant  .-- did you ever see such dancing -- was not it delightful -- miss woodhouse and mr  . frank churchillnever saw any thing equal to it  . oh very delightful indeedcan say nothing less forsuppose miss woodhouse and mr  . frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes  . and raising his voice still moredo not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too  .think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs  . weston is the very best country - dance player without exception in england  . now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return butcannot stay to hear it  . oh mr  . knightley one moment more something of consequence -- so shocked -- jane andare both so shocked about the apples what is the matter now to think of your sending us all your store apples  . you said you hadgreat many and now you have not one left  . we really are so shocked mrs  . hodges may well be angry  . william larkins mentioned it here  . you should not have done it indeed you should not  . ah he is off  . he never can bear to be thanked  . butthought he would have staid now and it would have beenpity not to have mentioned  .  .  .  . well returning to the roomhave not been able to succeed  . mr  . knightley cannot stop  . he is going to kingston  . he asked me if he could do any thing  .  .  .  . yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing  . oh yes my deardare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr  . knightley spoke loud  . you must have heard every thing to be sure  . cando any thing for you at kingston said he sojust mentioned  .  .  .  . oh miss woodhouse must you be going -- you seem but just come -- so very obliging of you  . emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that mrs  . weston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls  . chapter xi it may be possible to do without dancing entirely  . instances have been known of young people passing many many months successively without being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mind -- but whenbeginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly felt -- it must bevery heavy set that does not ask for more  . frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again and the last half - hour of an evening which mr  . woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject  . frankwas the first idea and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance  . but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr  . frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr  . weston could say of their exactly equal size that it waslittle the largest  . his first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr  . coleshould be finished there -- that the same party should be collected and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence  . mr  . weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and mrs  . weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple  . you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five had been repeated many times over  . and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr  . knightley  . yes that will be quite enough for pleasure  . you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room  . but soon it came to be on one side but will there be good room for five couple --really do not think there will  . on another and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up  . five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it  . it will not do to invite five couple  . it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment  . somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brotherand must be invited with the rest  . somebody else believed mrs  . gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had been asked  .word was put in forsecond young cox and at last mr  . weston naming one family of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it becamecertainty that the five couple would be at least ten andvery interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of  . the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other  . might not they use both rooms and dance across the passage it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wantedbetter  . emma said it would be awkward mrs  . weston was in distress about the supper and mr  . woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of health  . it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in  . oh no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence  .could not bear it for emma -- emma is not strong  . she would catchdreadful cold  . so would poor little harriet  . so you would all  . mrs  . weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of suchwild thing  . pray do not let them talk of it  . that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless  . do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing  . he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately  . he does not think of the draught  .do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing mrs  . weston was sorry for suchcharge  . she knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away  . every door was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again and with such good - will on frank churchillpart that the space whichquarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten  . we were too magnificent said he  . we allowed unnecessary room  . ten couple may stand here very well  . emma demurred  . it would becrowd --sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in very true he gravely replied it was very bad  . but still he went on measuring and still he ended withthink there will be very tolerable room for ten couple  . no no said she you are quite unreasonable  . it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing incrowd -- andcrowd inlittle room there is no denying it he replied  .agree with you exactly  .crowd inlittle room -- miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures infew words  . exquisite quite exquisite -- still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up  . it would bedisappointment to my father -- and altogether --do not know that --am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well  . emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry waslittle self - willed and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest  . had she intended ever to marry him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference and the character of his temper but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough  . before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme  . it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement  . well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened awayhope by the terrors of my fatherlittle rooms  .bringnew proposal on the subject --thought of my fatherwhich waits only your approbation to be acted upon  . mayhope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn the crown yes if you and mr  . woodhouse see no objection andtrust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there  . better accommodations he can promise them and notless grateful welcome than at randalls  . it is his own idea  . mrs  . weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied  . this is what we all feel  . oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable -- dreadful --felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield  . is not itgood exchange -- you consent --hope you consent it appears to meplan that nobody can object to if mr  . and mrs  . weston do not  .think it admirable and as far ascan answer for myself shall be most happy -- it seems the only improvement that could be  . papa do you not think it an excellent improvement she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully comprehended and then being quite new farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable  . no he thought it very far from an improvement --very bad plan -- much worse than the other  .room at an inn was always damp and dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited  . if they must dance they had better dance at randalls  . he had never been in the room at the crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight  .-- oh no --very bad plan  . they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere  .was going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any bodycatching cold -- so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr  . perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could  . sir said mr  . woodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr  . perry to be that sort of character  . mr  . perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill  . butdo not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your fatherhouse  . from the very circumstance of its being larger sir  . we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief  . open the windows -- but surely mr  . churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls  . nobody could be so imprudentnever heard of suchthing  . dancing with open windows --am sure neither your father nor mrs  . weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it  . ah sir -- butthoughtless young person will sometimes step behindwindow - curtain and throw upsash without its being suspected  .have often known it done myself  . have you indeed sir -- bless menever could have supposed it  . butlive out of the world and am often astonished at whathear  . however this does makedifference and perhaps when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things requiregood deal of consideration  . one cannot resolve upon them inhurry  . if mr  . and mrs  . weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done  . but unfortunately sir my time is so limited -- oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over  . there is no hurry at all  . if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses  . they will be so near their own stable  . so they will my dear  . that isgreat thing  . not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can  . ifcould be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is mrs  . stokes to be trusteddoubt it  .do not know her even by sight  .can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs  . westoncare  . mrs  . weston undertakes to direct the whole  . there papa -- now you must be satisfied -- our own dear mrs  . weston who is carefulness itself  . do not you remember what mr  . perry said so many years ago whenhad the measles if miss taylor undertakes to wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir  . how often haveheard you speak of it as suchcompliment to her aye very true  . mr  . perry did say so  .shall never forget it  . poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perrygreat attention  . he came four timesday forweek  . he said from the first it wasvery good sort -- which was our great comfort but the measles aredreadful complaint  .hope whenever poor isabellalittle ones have the measles she will send for perry  . my father and mrs  . weston are at the crown at this moment said frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house  .left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot  .was desired to say so from both  . it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there  . they can do nothing satisfactorily without you  . emma was most happy to be called to suchcouncil and her father engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people set off together without delay for the crown  . there were mr  . and mrs  . weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress and he finding every thing perfect  . emma said she this paper is worse thanexpected  . look in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thingcould have imagined  . my dear you are too particular said her husband  . what does all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight  . it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight  . we never see any thing of it on our club - nights  . the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never know when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares  . one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain  . it regardedsupper - room  . at the time of the ballroombeing built suppers had not been in question andsmall card - room adjoining was the only addition  . what was to be done this card - room would be wanted ascard - room now or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable supper another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house andlong awkward passage must be gone through to get at it  . this madedifficulty  . mrs  . weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper  . mrs  . weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches . set out in the little room but that was scouted aswretched suggestion  .private dance without sitting down to supper was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women and mrs  . weston must not speak of it again  . she then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observeddo not think it is so very small  . we shall not be many you know  . and mr  . weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through the passage was calling out you talkgreat deal of the length of this passage my dear  . it ismere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs  .wish said mrs  . weston one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best  . to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be  . yes very true cried frank very true  . you want your neighbours opinions  .do not wonder at you  . if one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the coles for instance  . they are not far off  . shallcall upon them or miss bates she is still nearer  .-- anddo not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body  .think we do wantlarger council  . supposego and invite miss bates to join us well -- if you please said mrs  . weston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use  . you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma  . she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing  . she will not even listen to your questions  .see no advantage in consulting miss bates  . but she is so amusing so extremely amusingam very fond of hearing miss bates talk  . andneed not bring the whole family you know  . here mr  . weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation  . aye do frank  .-- go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at once  . she will enjoy the schemeam sure anddo not knowproperer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties  . fetch miss bates  . we are growinglittle too nice  . she isstanding lesson of how to be happy  . but fetch them both  . invite them both  . both sir can the old lady  .  .  . the old lady no the young lady to be sure  .shall think yougreat blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece  . ohbeg your pardon sir  .did not immediately recollect  . undoubtedly if you wish itwill endeavour to persuade them both  . and away he ran  . long before he reappeared attending the short neat brisk - moving aunt and her elegant niece -- mrs  . weston likesweet - tempered woman andgood wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before -- indeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision  . all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth  . all the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs  . weston and mrs  . stokes  .-- every body invited was certainly to come frank had already written to enscombe to propose stayingfew days beyond his fortnight which could not possibly be refused  . anddelightful dance it was to be  . most cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must  . ascounsellor she was not wanted but as an approvermuch safer character she was truly welcome  . her approbation at once general and minute warm and incessant could not but please and for another half - hour they were all walking to and fro between the different rooms some suggesting some attending and all in happy enjoyment of the future  . the party did not break up without emmabeing positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr  . weston whisper to his wife he has asked her my dear  . thatright  .knew he would chapter xii one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma -- its being fixed forday within the granted term of frank churchillstay in surry for in spite of mr  . westonconfidence she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remainday beyond his fortnight  . but this was not judged feasible  . the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and forfew days they must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk -- in her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain  . enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word  . his wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed  . all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain of her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr  . knightleyprovoking indifference about it  . either because he did not dance himself or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement  . to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply than very well  . if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble forfew hours of noisy entertainmenthave nothing to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me  .-- oh yesmust be therecould not refuse andwill keep as much awake ascan butwould rather be at home looking over william larkinsweekaccount much ratherconfess  .-- pleasure in seeing dancing -- notindeed --never look at it --do not know who does  .-- fine dancingbelieve like virtue must be its own reward  . those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different  . this emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry  . it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree  . it made her animated -- open hearted -- she voluntarily said -- oh miss woodhousehope nothing may happen to prevent the ball  . whatdisappointment it would bedo look forward to itown with very great pleasure  . it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins  . no -- she was more and more convinced that mrs  . weston was quite mistaken in that surmise  . there wasgreat deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love  . alas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr  . knightley  . two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing  .letter arrived from mr  . churchill to urge his nephewinstant return  . mrs  . churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him she had been invery suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay  . the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma innote from mrs  . weston instantly  . as to his going it was inevitable  . he must be gone withinfew hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance  . he knew her illnesses they never occurred but for her own convenience  . mrs  . weston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon  . this wretched note was the finale of emmabreakfast  . when once it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim  . the loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling -- it was too wretched -- suchdelightful evening as it would have been -- every body so happy and she and her partner the happiest --said it would be so was the only consolation  . her fatherfeelings were quite distinct  . he thought principally of mrs  . churchillillness and wanted to know how she was treated and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed but they would all be safer at home  . emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared but if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him  . he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it  . his dejection was most evident  . he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say of all horrid things leave - taking is the worst  . but you will come again said emma  . this will not be your only visit to randalls  . ah -- shaking his head -- the uncertainty of whenmay be able to return --shall try for it withzeal -- it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares -- and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- butam afraid -- they did not stir last spring --am afraid it iscustom gone for ever  . our poor ball must be quite given up  . ah that ball -- why did we wait for any thing -- why not seize the pleasure at once -- how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation -- you told us it would be so  .-- oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right indeedam very sorry to be right in this instance  .would much rather have been merry than wise  . ifcan come again we are still to have our ball  . my father depends on it  . do not forget your engagement  . emma looked graciously  . suchfortnight as it has been he continued every day more precious and more delightful than the day before -- every day making me less fit to bear any other place  . happy those who can remain at highbury as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughingwill venture to ask whether you did not comelittle doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectationsam sure we do  .am sure you did not much expect to like us  . you would not have been so long in coming if you had hadpleasant idea of highbury  . he laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment emma was convinced that it had been so  . and you must be off this very morning yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together andmust be off immediately  .am almost afraid that every moment will bring him  . not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss batespowerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours  . yes --have called there passing the doorthought it better  . it wasright thing to do  .went in for three minutes and was detained by miss batesbeing absent  . she was out andfelt it impossible not to wait till she came in  . she iswoman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight  . it was better to pay my visit then -- he hesitated got up walked towindow  . in short said he perhaps miss woodhouse --think you can hardly be quite without suspicion -- he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts  . she hardly knew what to say  . it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious which she did not wish  . forcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then -- he was silent  . she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting on what she had said and trying to understand the manner  . she heard him sigh  . it was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh  . he could not believe her to be encouraging him  .few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and inmore determined manner said it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield  . my regard for hartfield is most warm -- he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed  .-- he was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance mr  . woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made him composed  .very few minutes more however completed the present trial  . mr  . weston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave  .shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation  .shall hear of every thing that is going on among you  .have engaged mrs  . weston to correspond with me  . she has been so kind as to promise it  . oh the blessing offemale correspondent when one is really interested in the absent -- she will tell me every thing  . in her lettersshall be at dear highbury again  .very friendly shake of the handvery earnest good - bye closed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill  . short had been the notice -- short their meeting he was gone and emma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so greatloss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much  . it wassad change  . they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival  . certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners it had beenvery happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days  . to complete every other recommendation he had almost told her that he loved her  . what strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to was another point but at present she could not doubt his havingdecidedly warm admirationconscious preference of herself and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that she must belittle in love with him in spite of every previous determination against it  .certainly must said she  . this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thingbeing dull and insipid about the house --must be in loveshould be the oddest creature in the world ifwere not -- forfew weeks at least  . well evil to some is always good to others  .shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr  . knightley will be happy  . he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes  . mr  . knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness  . he could not say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck it was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet her composure was odious  . she had been particularly unwell however suffering from headache todegree which made her aunt declare that had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have attended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health  . chapter xiii emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love  . her ideas only varied as to the how much  . at first she thought it wasgood deal and afterwards but little  . she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr  . and mrs  . weston she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient forletter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring  . but on the other hand she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working formingthousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she refused him  . their affection was always to subside into friendship  . every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting but still they were to part  . when she became sensible of this it struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never to marrystrong attachment certainly must produce more ofstruggle than she could foresee in her own feelings  .do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said she  .-- in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to makingsacrifice  .do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness  . so much the better  .certainly will not persuade myself to feel more thando  .am quite enough in love  .should be sorry to be more  . upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings  . he is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed -- and when he comes again if his affection continuemust be on my guard not to encourage it  .-- it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up  . not thatimagine he can thinkhave been encouraging him hitherto  . no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched  . could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different  .-- still howevermust be on my guard  . this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is butdo not know thatexpect it willdo not look upon him to be quite the sort of man --do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy  .-- his feelings are warm butcan imagine them rather changeable  .-- every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved  .--shall do very well again afterlittle while -- and then it will begood thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives andshall have been let off easily  . when his letter to mrs  . weston arrived emma had the perusal of it and she read it withdegree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength  . it waslong well - written letter giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision  . no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the language of real feeling towards mrs  . weston and the transition from highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety  .-- the charm of her own name was not wanting  . miss woodhouse appeared more than once and never withoutsomething of pleasing connexion eithercompliment to her taste orremembrance of what she had said and in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed  . compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words --had notspare moment on tuesday as you know for miss woodhousebeautiful little friend  . pray make my excuses and adieus to her  . this emma could not doubt was all for herself  . harriet was remembered only from being her friend  . his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated mrs  . churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fixtime for coming to randalls again  . gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to mrs  . weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her  . her intentions were unchanged  . her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition ofscheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness  . his recollection of harriet and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the idea of harrietsucceeding her in his affections  . was it impossible -- no  .-- harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour  .-- for harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed  .must not dwell upon it said she  .--must not think of it  .know the danger of indulging such speculations  . but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship whichcan already look forward to with pleasure  . it was well to havecomfort in store on harrietbehalf though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil in that quarter was at hand  . as frank churchillarrival had succeeded mr  . eltonengagement in the conversation of highbury as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now upon frank churchilldisappearance mr  . eltonconcerns were assuming the most irresistible form  .-- his wedding - day was named  . he would soon be among them again mr  . elton and his bride  . there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before mr  . elton and his bride was in every bodymouth and frank churchill was forgotten  . emma grew sick at the sound  . she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr  . elton and harrietmind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength  . with mr  . westonball in view at least there had beengreat deal of insensibility to other things but it was now too evident that she had not attained suchstate of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage bell - ringing and all  . poor harriet was influtter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give  . emma felt that she could not do too much for her that harriet hadright to all her ingenuity and all her patience but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions the same  . harriet listened submissively and said it was very true -- it was just as miss woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before  . at last emma attacked her on another ground  . your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr  . eltonmarrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me  . you could not give megreater reproof for the mistakefell into  . it was all my doingknow  .have not forgotten itassure you  .-- deceived myselfdid very miserably deceive you -- and it will bepainful reflection to me for ever  . do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it  . harriet felt this too much to utter more thanfew words of eager exclamation  . emma continuedhave not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr  . elton for my sake because for your own sake ratherwould wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comforthabit of self - command in youconsideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity  . these are the motives whichhave been pressing on you  . they are very important -- and sorryam that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them  . my being saved from pain isvery secondary consideration  .want you to save yourself from greater pain  . perhapsmay sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me  . this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest  . the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse whom she really loved extremely made her wretched forwhile and when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably  . you who have been the best friendever had in my life -- want gratitude to you -- nobody is equal to you --care for nobody asdo for you -- oh miss woodhouse how ungratefulhave been such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before  . there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to herself  . there is nothing to be compared to it  . warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attractionam sure it will  . it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives isabella all her popularity  .--have it not -- butknow how to prize and respect it  .-- harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives  . dear harriet --would not change you for the clearest - headed longest - sighted best - judging female breathing  . oh the coldness ofjane fairfax -- harriet is worthhundred such -- and forwife --sensible manwife -- it is invaluable  .mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet chapter xiv mrs  . elton was first seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied bybride inpew and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or not pretty at all  . emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she madepoint of harrietgoing with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible  . she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to lace up her boot without recollecting  .thousand vexatious thoughts would recur  . compliments charades and horrible blunders and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent  . the visit was of course short and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothing - meaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing  . she did not really like her  . she would not be inhurry to find fault but she suspected that there was no elegance -- ease but not elegance  .-- she was almost sure that foryoung womanstrangerbride there was too much ease  . her person was rather good her face not unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant  . emma thought at least it would turn out so  . as for mr  . elton his manners did not appear -- but no she would not permithasty orwitty word from herself about his manners  . it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits andman had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it  . the woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr  . elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as could be  . well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin well miss woodhouse withgentle sigh what do you think of her -- is not she very charming there waslittle hesitation in emmaanswer  . oh yes -- very --very pleasing young woman  .think her beautiful quite beautiful  . very nicely dressed indeedremarkably elegant gown  .am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love  . oh no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all  .--pretty fortune and she came in his way  .dare say returned harriet sighing againdare say she was very much attached to him  . perhaps she might but it is not every manfate to marry the woman who loves him best  . miss hawkins perhaps wantedhome and thought this the best offer she was likely to have  . yes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever havebetter  . wellwish them happy with all my heart  . and now miss woodhousedo not thinkshall mind seeing them again  . he is just as superior as ever -- but being married you know it is quitedifferent thing  . no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraidcan sit and admire him now without any great misery  . to know that he has not thrown himself away is suchcomfort -- she does seemcharming young woman just what he deserves  . happy creature he called her augusta  . how delightful when the visit was returned emma made up her mind  . she could then see more and judge better  . from harriethappening not to be at hartfield and her fatherbeing present to engage mr  . elton she hadquarter of an hour of the ladyconversation to herself and could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs  . elton wasvain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance that she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which had been formed inbad school pert and familiar that all her notions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would certainly do mr  . elton no good  . harriet would have beenbetter match  . if not wise or refined herself she would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of her own set  . the rich brother - in - law near bristol was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him  . the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother mr  . sucklingseat --comparison of hartfield to maple grove  . the grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the house was modern and well - built  . mrs  . elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or imagine  . very like maple grove indeed -- she was quite struck by the likeness -- that room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at maple grove her sisterfavourite room  . -- mr  . elton was appealed to  .-- was not it astonishingly like -- she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove  . and the staircase -- you know ascame inobserved how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house  .really could not help exclaimingassure you miss woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded ofplaceam so extremely partial to as maple grove  .have spent so many happy months there withlittle sigh of sentiment  .charming place undoubtedly  . every body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quitehome  . whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind  .always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony  . emma made as slightreply as she could but it was fully sufficient for mrs  . elton who only wanted to be talking herself  . so extremely like maple grove and it is not merely the house -- the groundsassure you as far ascould observe are strikingly like  . the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn andhadglimpse offine large tree withbench round it which put me so exactly in mind my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place  . people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style  . emma doubted the truth of this sentiment  . she hadgreat idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed and therefore only said in reply when you have seen more of this countryam afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield  . surry is full of beauties  . oh yesam quite aware of that  . it is the garden of england you know  . surry is the garden of england  . yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction  . many countiesbelieve are called the garden of england as well as surry  . nofancy not replied mrs  . elton withmost satisfied smile  .never heard any county but surry called so  . emma was silenced  . my brother and sister have promised usvisit in the spring or summer at farthest continued mrs  . elton and that will be our time for exploring  . while they are with us we shall exploregreat dealdare say  . they will have their barouche - landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well  . they would hardly come in their chaisethink at that season of the year  . indeed when the time draws onshall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau it will be so very much preferable  . when people come intobeautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr  . suckling is extremely fond of exploring  . we explored to king- weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche - landau  . you have many parties of that kind heresuppose miss woodhouse every summer no not immediately here  . we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we arevery quiet set of peoplebelieve more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure  . ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort  . nobody can be more devoted to home thanam  .was quiteproverb for it at maple grove  . manytime has selina said when she has been going to bristolreally cannot get this girl to move from the house  .absolutely must go in by myself thoughhate being stuck up in the barouche - landau withoutcompanion but augustabelieve with her own good - will would never stir beyond the park paling  . manytime has she said so and yetam no advocate for entire seclusion  .think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it isvery bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world inproper degree without living in it either too much or too little  .perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse -- looking towards mr  . woodhouse your fatherstate of health must begreat drawback  . why does not he try bath -- indeed he should  . let me recommend bath to you  .assure youhave no doubt of its doing mr  . woodhouse good  . my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr  . perry whose namedare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now  . ah thata great pity forassure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give  . in my bath lifehave seen such instances of it and it is so cheerfulplace that it could not fail of being of use to mr  . woodhousespirits whichunderstand are sometimes much depressed  . and as to its recommendations to youfancyneed not take much pains to dwell on them  . the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood  . it would becharming introduction for you who have lived so secludedlife andcould immediately secure you some of the best society in the place  .line from me would bring youlittle host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs  . partridge the ladyhave always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with  . it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite  . the idea of her being indebted to mrs  . elton for what was called an introduction -- of her going into public under the auspices offriend of mrs  . elton-- probably some vulgar dashing widow who with the help ofboarder just madeshift to live -- the dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have given and only thanked mrs  . elton coolly but their going to bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father  . and then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly  .do not ask whether you are musical mrs  . elton  . upon these occasionsladycharacter generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you aresuperior performer  . oh no indeedmust protest against any such idea  .superior performer -- very far from itassure you  . consider from how partialquarter your information came  .am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond -- and my friends sayam not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree  . you miss woodhousewell know play delightfully  .assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear whatmusical societyam got into  .absolutely cannot do without music  . it isnecessary of life to me and having always been used tovery musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have beenmost serious sacrifice  .honestly said as much to mr  . . when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing whathad been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension  . when he was speaking of it in that wayhonestly said that the worldcould give up -- parties balls plays -- forhad no fear of retirement  . blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to me  .could do very well without it  . to those who had no resources it wasdifferent thing but my resources made me quite independent  . and as to smaller - sized rooms thanhad been used toreally could not give itthought  .hopedwas perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description  . certainlyhad been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove butdid assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments  . but saidto be quite honestdo not thinkcan live without something ofmusical society  .condition for nothing else but without music life would beblank to me  . we cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr  . elton would hesitate to assure you of there beingvery musical society in highbury andhope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive  . no indeedhave no doubts at all on that head  .am delighted to find myself in suchcircle  .hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together  .think miss woodhouse you andmust establishmusical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours  . will not it begood plan if we exert ourselvesthink we shall not be long in want of allies  . something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know -- there issad story against them in general  . they are but too apt to give up music  . but you who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger surelyshould hope not but really whenlook around among my acquaintancetremble  . selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly  . and the same may be said of mrs  . jeffereys -- clara partridge that was -- and of the two milmans now mrs  . bird and mrs  . james cooper and of more thancan enumerate  . upon my word it is enough to put one infright  .used to be quite angry with selina but reallybegin now to comprehend thatmarried woman has many things to call her attention  .believewas half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper  . but every thing of that kind said emma will soon be in so regulartrain -- well said mrs  . elton laughing we shall see  . emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and aftermomentpause mrs  . elton chose another subject  . we have been calling at randalls said she and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be  .like them extremely  . mr  . weston seems an excellent creature -- quitefirst - rate favourite with me alreadyassure you  . and she appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her that it wins upon one directly  . she was your governessthink emma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs  . elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on  . having understood as muchwas rather astonished to find her so very lady - like but she is really quite the gentlewoman  . mrs  . westonmanners said emma were always particularly good  . their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman  . and who do you think came in while we were there emma was quite atloss  . the tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess knightley continued mrs  . elton knightley himself -- was not it lucky -- for not being within when he called the other dayhad never seen him before and of course as so particularfriend of mr  . .i hadgreat curiosity  . my friend knightley had been so often mentioned thatwas really impatient to see him andmust do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend  . knightley is quite the gentleman  .like him very much  . decidedlythinkvery gentleman - like man  . happily it was now time to be gone  . they were off and emma could breathe  . insufferable woman was her immediate exclamation  . worse thanhad supposed  . absolutely insufferable knightley --could not have believed it  . knightley -- never seen him in her life before and call him knightley -- and discover that he isgentlemanlittle upstart vulgar being with her mr  . . and her caro sposo and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery  . actually to discover that mr  . knightley isgentlemandoubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to belady  .could not have believed it and to propose that she andshould unite to formmusical club one would fancy we were bosom friends and mrs  . weston -- astonished that the person who had brought me up should begentlewoman worse and worse  .never met with her equal  . much beyond my hopes  . harriet is disgraced by any comparison  . oh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here how angry and how diverted he would be ah theream -- thinking of him directly  . always the first person to be thought of howcatch myself out frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind -- all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending  . well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her before she seemsvery pretty sort of young lady anddare say she was very much pleased with you  . she speakslittle too quick  .little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear  . butbelieveam nicedo not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor  . however she seemsvery obliging pretty - behaved young lady and no doubt will make himvery good wife  . thoughthink he had better not have married  .made the best excusescould for not having been able to wait on him and mrs  . elton on this happy occasionsaid thathopedshould in the course of the summer  . butought to have gone before  . not to wait uponbride is very remiss  . ah it shews whatsad invalidam butdo not like the corner into vicarage lane  .dare say your apologies were accepted sir  . mr  . elton knows you  . yes butyoung lady --bride --ought to have paid my respects to her if possible  . it was being very deficient  . but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects tobride it ought to be no recommendation to you  . it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them  . no my dearnever encouraged any body to marry butwould always wish to pay every proper attention tolady -- andbride especially is never to be neglected  . more is avowedly due to her  .bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may  . well papa if this is not encouragement to marrydo not know what is  . andshould never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies  . my dear you do not understand me  . this ismatter of mere common politeness and good - breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry  . emma had done  . her father was growing nervous and could not understand her  . her mind returned to mrs  . eltonoffences and long very long did they occupy her  . chapter xv emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill opinion of mrs  . elton  . her observation had been pretty correct  . such as mrs  . elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met again -- self - important presuming familiar ignorant and ill - bred  . she hadlittle beauty andlittle accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improvecountry neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held suchplace in society as mrs  . eltonconsequence only could surpass  . there was no reason to suppose mr  . elton thought at all differently from his wife  . he seemed not merely happy with her but proud  . he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought suchwoman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss batesgood - will or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied so that mrs  . eltonpraise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked withgood grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed  . in one respect mrs  . elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first  . her feelings altered towards emma  .-- offended probably by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant and though the effect was agreeable the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing emmadislike  . her manners too -- and mr  . eltonwere unpleasant towards harriet  . they were sneering and negligent  . emma hoped it must rapidly work harrietcure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much  .-- it was not to be doubted that poor harrietattachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story undercolouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been given also  . she was of course the object of their joint dislike  .-- when they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her foundbroader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet  . mrs  . elton tookgreat fancy to jane fairfax and from the first  . not merely whenstate of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she was not satisfied with expressingnatural and reasonable admiration -- but without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend her  .-- before emma had forfeited her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs  . eltonknight - errantry on the subject  .-- jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse  .--quite rave about jane fairfax  .--sweet interesting creature  . so mild and ladylike -- and with such talents --assure youthink she has very extraordinary talents  .do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well  .know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point  . oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at my warmth -- but upon my wordtalk of nothing but jane fairfax  .-- and her situation is so calculated to affect one -- miss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her  . we must bring her forward  . such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown  .--dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet full manyflower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air  . we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax  .cannot think there is any danger of it was emmacalm answer -- and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfaxsituation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs  . campbellhave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown  . oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away  .-- whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end andthink she feels it  .am sure she does  . she is very timid and silent  . one can see that she feels the want of encouragement  .like her the better for it  .must confess it isrecommendation to me  .amgreat advocate for timidity -- andam sure one does not often meet with it  .-- but in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing  . ohassure you jane fairfax isvery delightful character and interests me more thancan express  . you appear to feelgreat deal -- butam not aware how you or any of miss fairfaxacquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than -- my dear miss woodhousevast deal may be done by those who dare to act  . you andneed not be afraid  . if we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations  . we have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live instyle which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient  .--should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up suchdinner as could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of it  .have no idea of that sort of thing  . it is not likely thatshould considering whathave been used to  . my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense  . maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr  . suckling in income  .-- however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax  .--shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherevercan shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation  . my acquaintance is so very extensive thathave little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly  .--shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us  .am sure they will like her extremely and when she getslittle acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating  .--shall have her very often indeed while they are with me anddare say we shall sometimes findseat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties  . poor jane fairfax -- thought emma  .-- you have not deserved this  . you may have done wrong with regard to mr  . dixon but this ispunishment beyond what you can have merited -- the kindness and protection of mrs  . elton -- jane fairfax and jane fairfax  . heavens let me not suppose that she dares go about emma woodhouse - ing me -- but upon my honour there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that womantongue emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated withdear miss woodhouse  . the change on mrs  . eltonside soon afterwards appeared and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs  . elton nor under mrs  . eltonguidance the very active patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others ingeneral way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done  . she looked on with some amusement  .-- miss batesgratitude for mrs  . eltonattentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth  . she was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable affable delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as mrs  . elton meant to be considered  . emmaonly surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs  . elton as she seemed to do  . she heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons spendingday with the eltons this was astonishing -- she could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer  . she isriddle quiteriddle said she  .-- to chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort and now to chuse the mortification of mrs  . eltonnotice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection  . jane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells were gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there  . according to miss bates -- it all came from her -- mrs  . dixon had written most pressingly  . would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist but still she had declined it she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation was emmaconclusion  . she must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself  . there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere  .-- she is not to be with the dixons  . the decree is issued by somebody  . but why must she consent to be with the eltons -- here is quiteseparate puzzle  . upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before the few who knew her opinion of mrs  . elton mrs  . weston ventured this apology for jane  . we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma -- but it is better than being always at home  . her aunt isgood creature but asconstant companion must be very tiresome  . we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to  . you are right mrs  . weston said mr  . knightley warmly miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of formingjust opinion of mrs  . elton  . could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her  . but withreproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from mrs  . elton which nobody else pays her  . emma felt that mrs  . weston was giving hermomentary glance and she was herself struck by his warmth  . withfaint blush she presently replied such attentions as mrs  . eltoni should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax  . mrs  . eltoninvitationsshould have imagined any thing but inviting  .should not wonder said mrs  . weston if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunteagerness in accepting mrs  . eltoncivilities for her  . poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her intogreater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish oflittle change  . both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and afterfew minutes silence he said another thing must be taken into consideration too -- mrs  . elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her  . we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence ofsomething beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other --something more early implanted  . we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before  . we feel things differently  . and besides the operation of this asgeneral principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs  . elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs  . elton treats her with all the respect which she hasclaim to  . suchwoman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs  . eltonway before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness  .know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma  . little henry was in her thoughts andmixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say  . yes he replied any body may know how highlythink of her  . and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stopping -- it was better however to know the worst at once -- she hurried on -- and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is  . the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other  . mr  . knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered oh are you there -- but you are miserably behindhand  . mr  . cole gave mehint of it six weeks ago  . he stopped  .-- emma felt her foot pressed by mrs  . weston and did not herself know what to think  . inmoment he went on -- that will never be howevercan assure you  . miss fairfaxdare say would not have me ifwere to ask her -- andam very sureshall never ask her  . emma returned her friendpressure with interest and was pleased enough to exclaim you are not vain mr  . knightley  .will say that for you  . he seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtful -- and inmanner which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said so you have been settling thatshould marry jane fairfax no indeedhave not  . you have scolded me too much for match - making for me to presume to take suchliberty with you  . whatsaid just now meant nothing  . one says those sort of things of course without any idea ofserious meaning  . oh no upon my wordhave not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body  . you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married  . mr  . knightley was thoughtful again  . the result of his reverie was no emmado not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize  .--never hadthought of her in that wayassure you  . and soon afterwards jane fairfax isvery charming young woman -- but not even jane fairfax is perfect  . she hasfault  . she has not the open temper whichman would wish for inwife  . emma could not but rejoice to hear that she hadfault  . well said she and you soon silenced mr  . colesuppose yes very soon  . he gave mequiet hinttold him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more  . cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours  . in that respect how unlike dear mrs  . elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the worldwonder how she speaks of the coles -- what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley -- what can she do for mr  . cole and soam not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her  . mrs  . weston your argument weighs most with me  .can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates thancan believe in the triumph of miss fairfaxmind over mrs  . elton  .have no faith in mrs  . eltonacknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding  .cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring herpermanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau  . jane fairfax has feeling said mr  . knightley --do not accuse her of want of feeling  . her sensibilitiessuspect are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self - controul but it wants openness  . she is reserved more reservedthink than she used to be -- andlove an open temper  . no -- till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head  .saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond  . well mrs  . weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to mr  . knightleymarrying jane fairfax why really dear emmasay that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her thatshould not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last  . do not beat me  . chapter xvi every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr  . elton was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage  . dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to havedisengaged day  .see how it is said she  .see whatlifeam to lead among you  . upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated  . we really seem quite the fashion  . if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable  . from monday next to saturdayassure you we have notdisengaged day --woman with fewer resources thanhave need not have been atloss  . no invitation came amiss to her  . her bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given hertaste for dinners  . she waslittle shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at the poor attempt at rout - cakes and there being no ice in the highbury card - parties  . mrs  . bates mrs  . perry mrs  . goddard and others weregood deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged  . in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order  . emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied withoutdinner at hartfield for the eltons  . they must not do less than others or she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful resentment  .dinner there must be  . after emma had talked about it for ten minutes mr  . woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him  . the persons to be invited required little thought  . besides the eltons it must be the westons and mr  . knightley so far it was all of course -- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth -- but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harrietbegging to be allowed to decline it  . she would rather not be in his company more than she could help  . she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable  . if miss woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home  . it was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it possible enough for wishing  . she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax  .-- since her last conversation with mrs  . weston and mr  . knightley she was more conscience - stricken about jane fairfax than she had often been  .-- mr  . knightleywords dwelt with her  . he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs  . elton which nobody else paid her  . this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful  .-- of the same age -- and always knowing her --ought to have been more her friend  .-- she will never like me now  .have neglected her too long  . butwill shew her greater attention thanhave done  . every invitation was successful  . they were all disengaged and all happy  .-- the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over  .circumstance rather unlucky occurred  . the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and auntvisit of some weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and staying one whole day at hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party  .-- his professional engagements did not allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so  . mr  . woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear -- and here would beninth -- and emma apprehended that it would beninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in withdinner - party  . she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very immaterial  . she thought it in realitysad exchange for herself to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother  . the event was more favourable to mr  . woodhouse than to emma  . john knightley came but mr  . weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day  . he might be able to join them in the evening but certainly not to dinner  . mr  . woodhouse was quite at ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the chief of even emmavexation  . the day came the party were punctually assembled and mr  . john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable  . instead of drawing his brother off towindow while they waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax  . mrs  . elton as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence -- wanting only to observe enough for isabellainformation -- but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance andquiet girl and he could talk to her  . he had met her before breakfast as he was returning fromwalk with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain  . it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he saidhope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning oram sure you must have been wet  .-- we scarcely got home in time  .hope you turned directly  .went only to the post - office said she and reached home before the rain was much  . it is my daily errand  .always fetch the letters whenam here  . it saves trouble and issomething to get me out  .walk before breakfast does me good  . notwalk in the rainshould imagine  . no but it did not absolutely rain whenset out  . mr  . john knightley smiled and replied that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door whenhad the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before  . the post - office hasgreat charm at one period of our lives  . when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for  . there waslittle blush and then this answermust not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and thereforecannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters  . indifferent oh no --never conceived you could become indifferent  . letters are no matter of indifference they are generallyvery positive curse  . you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship  .have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly  . business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does  . ah you are not serious now  .know mr  . john knightley too well --am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body  .can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation  . you have every body dearest to you always at handprobably never shall again and therefore tillhave outlived all my affectionspost - officethink must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to - day  . whentalked of your being altered by time by the progress of years said john knightleymeant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings  .consider one as including the other  . time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the changehad in view for you  . as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects ashave  . it was kindly said and very far from giving offence  .pleasant thank you seemed meant to laugh it off butblushquivering liptear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyondlaugh  . her attention was now claimed by mr  . woodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity saidam very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain  . young ladies should take care of themselves  .-- young ladies are delicate plants  . they should take care of their health and their complexion  . my dear did you change your stockings yes sirdid indeed andam very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me  . my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for  .--hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well  . they are some of my very old friends  .wish my health allowed me to bebetter neighbour  . you do usgreat deal of honour to - dayam sure  . my daughter andare both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield  . the kind - hearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy  . by this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs  . elton and her remonstrances now opened upon jane  . my dear jane what is thishear -- going to the post - office in the rain -- this must not beassure you  .-- you sad girl how could you do suchthing -- it issignwas not there to take care of you  . jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold  . oh do not tell me  . you really arevery sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourself  .-- to the post - office indeed mrs  . weston did you ever hear the like you andmust positively exert our authority  . my advice said mrs  . weston kindly and persuasivelycertainly do feel tempted to give  . miss fairfax you must not run such risks  .-- liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year  . the springalways think requires more than common care  . better wait an hour or two or even halfday for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again  . now do not you feel that you had yesam sure you are much too reasonable  . you look as if you would not do suchthing again  . oh she shall not do suchthing again eagerly rejoined mrs  . elton  . we will not allow her to do suchthing again -- and nodding significantly -- there must be some arrangement made there must indeed  .shall speak to mr  . . the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our menforget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you  . that will obviate all difficulties you know and from usreally think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation  . you are extremely kind said jane butcannot give up my early walk  .am advised to be out of doors as much ascanmust walk somewhere and the post - office is an object and upon my wordhave scarcely ever hadbad morning before  . my dear jane say no more about it  . the thing is determined that is laughing affectedly as far ascan presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master  . you know mrs  . weston you andmust be cautious how we express ourselves  . butdo flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out  . ifmeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled  . excuse me said jane earnestlycannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant  . if the errand were notpleasure to me it could be done as it always is whenam not here by my grandmama . oh my dear but so much as patty has to do -- and it iskindness to employ our men  . jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead of answering she began speaking again to mr  . john knightley  . the post - office iswonderful establishment said she  .-- the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing it is certainly very well regulated  . so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom thatletter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong -- and not one inmillionsuppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder  . the clerks grow expert from habit  .-- they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them  . if you want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it  . that is the key togreat deal of capacity  . the public pays and must be served well  . the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made  .have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails infamily and where the same master teaches it is natural enough  . but for that reasonshould imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get  . isabella and emmathink do write very much alike  .have not always known their writing apart  . yes said his brother hesitatingly there islikeness  .know what you mean -- but emmahand is the strongest  . isabella and emma both write beautifully said mr  . woodhouse and always did  . and so does poor mrs  . weston -- with halfsigh and halfsmile at her  .never saw any gentlemanhandwriting -- emma began looking also at mrs  . weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs  . weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect now how amgoing to introduce him -- amunequal to speaking his name at once before all these people is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase -- your yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in yorkshire -- that would be the waysuppose ifwere very bad  .-- nocan pronounce his name without the smallest distress  .certainly get better and better  .-- now for it  . mrs  . weston was disengaged and emma began again -- mr  . frank churchill writes one of the best gentlemanhandsever saw  .do not admire it said mr  . knightley  . it is too small -- wants strength  . it is likewomanwriting  . this was not submitted to by either lady  . they vindicated him against the base aspersion  . no it by no means wanted strength -- it was notlarge hand but very clear and certainly strong  . had not mrs  . weston any letter about her to produce no she had heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put it away  . if we were in the other room said emma ifhad my writing - deskam surecould producespecimen  .havenote of his  .-- do not you remember mrs  . weston employing him to write for you one day he chose to say he was employed -- well wellhave that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr  . knightley  . oh whengallant young man like mr  . frank churchill said mr  . knightley dryly writes tofair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best  . dinner was on table  .-- mrs  . elton before she could be spoken to was ready and before mr  . woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour was saying -- mustgo firstreally am ashamed of always leading the way  . janesolicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma  . she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any  . she suspected that it had that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been in vain  . she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual --glow both of complexion and spirits  . she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mails -- it was at her tongueend -- but she abstained  . she was quite determined not to utterword that should hurt jane fairfaxfeelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each  . chapter xvii when the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties -- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs  . elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself  . she and mrs  . weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together  . mrs  . elton left them no choice  . if jane repressed her forlittle time she soon began again and though much that passed between them was inhalf - whisper especially on mrs  . eltonside there was no avoidingknowledge of their principal subjects the post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant to jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of mrs  . eltonmeditated activity  . here is april come said sheget quite anxious about you  . june will soon be here  . buthave never fixed on june or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general  . but have you really heard of nothinghave not even made any inquirydo not wish to make any yet  . oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing  .not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs  . elton who can have thought of it ashave done but you have not seen so much of the world ashave  . you do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations  .sawvast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove  .cousin of mr  . suckling mrs  . bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle  . wax - candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs  . braggeis the onewould most wish to see you in  . colonel and mrs  . campbell are to be in town again by midsummer said jane  .must spend some time with themam sure they will want it -- afterwardsmay probably be glad to dispose of myself  . butwould not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present  . trouble ayeknow your scruples  . you are afraid of giving me trouble butassure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you thanam  .shall write to mrs  . partridge inday or two and shall give herstrict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible  . thank you butwould rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearerdo not wish to be giving any body trouble  . but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us  . your inexperience really amuses mesituation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained atmomentnotice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly  . excuse me ma am but this is by no means my intentionmake no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends  . whenam quite determined as to the timeam not at all afraid of being long unemployed  . there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something -- offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect  . oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you meanfling at the slave - tradeassure you mr  . suckling was always ratherfriend to the abolition  .did not meanwas not thinking of the slave - trade replied jane governess - tradeassure you was all thathad in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victimsdo not know where it lies  . butonly mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to themshould have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do  . something that would do repeated mrs  . elton  . aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourself --know whatmodest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation infamily not moving incertain circle or able to command the elegancies of life  . you are very obliging but as to all thatam very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortificationsthink would only be the greatershould suffer more from comparison  .gentlemanfamily is all thatshould condition for  .know youknow you you would take up with any thing butshall belittle more nice andam sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you haveright to move in the first circle  . your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chose -- that is --do not know -- if you knew the harp you might do all thatam very sure but you sing as well as play -- yesreally believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you chose -- and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells orhave any rest  . you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of suchsituation together said jane they are pretty sure to be equal howeveram very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me  .am exceedingly obliged to you mrs  . eltonam obliged to any body who feels for me butam quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer  . for two or three months longershall remain wheream and asam  . andam quite serious tooassure you replied mrs  . elton gaily in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us  . in this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr  . woodhouse came into the room her vanity had thenchange of object and emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to jane here comes this dear old beau of mineprotest -- only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men -- whatdear creature he is --assure youlike him excessively  .admire all that quaint old - fashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me  . but this good old mr  . woodhousewish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner  . ohassure youbegan to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous  .fancyam ratherfavourite he took notice of my gown  . how do you like it -- selinachoice -- handsomethink butdo not know whether it is not over - trimmedhave the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quitehorror of finery  .must put onfew ornaments now because it is expected of me  .bride you know must appear likebride but my natural taste is all for simplicitysimple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery  . butam quite in the minoritybelieve few people seem to value simplicity of dress -- show and finery are every thing  .have some notion of putting suchtrimming as this to my white and silver poplin  . do you think it will look well the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when mr  . weston made his appearance among them  . he had returned tolate dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over  . he had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize -- but there was great joy  . mr  . woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to see him before  . john knightley only was in mute astonishment  .-- thatman who might have spent his evening quietly at home afterday of business in london should set off again and walk halfmile to another manhouse for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers wascircumstance to strike him deeply  .man who had been in motion since eightclock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone -- suchman to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening ofcold sleety april day rush out again into the world -- could he bytouch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have beenmotive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party  . john knightley looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and saidcould not have believed it even of him  . mr  . weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being principal talker whichday spent anywhere from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding tofamily communication which though principally addressed to mrs  . weston he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room  . he gave herletter it was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it  . read it read it said he it will give you pleasure onlyfew lines -- will not take you long read it to emma  . the two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time invoicelittle subdued but very audible to every body  . well he is coming you see good newsthink  . well what do you say to it --always told you he would be here again soon did not-- anne my dear did notalways tell you so and you would not believe me -- in town next week you see -- at the latestdare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to - morrow or saturday  . as to her illness all nothing of course  . but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town  . they will staygood while when they do come and he will be half his time with us  . this is precisely whatwanted  . well pretty good news is not it have you finished it has emma read it all put it up put it up we will havegood talk about it some other time but it will not do now  .shall only just mention the circumstance to the others incommon way  . mrs  . weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion  . her looks and words had nothing to restrain them  . she was happy she knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy  . her congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak so fluently  . she waslittle occupied in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she rather thought was considerable  . mr  . weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy bypartial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already  . it was well that he took every bodyjoy for granted or he might not have thought either mr  . woodhouse or mr  . knightley particularly delighted  . they were the first entitled after mrs  . weston and emma to be made happy -- from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have been too positive an interruption and finding himself close to mrs  . elton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her  . chapter xviiihopeshall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you said mr  . weston  . mrs  . elton very willing to supposeparticular compliment intended her by suchhope smiled most graciously  . you have heard ofcertain frank churchillpresume he continued -- and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name  . oh yes andshall be very happy in his acquaintance  .am sure mr  . elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage  . you are very obliging  .-- frank will be extremely happyam sure  .-- he is to be in town next week if not sooner  . we have notice of it inletter to - day  .met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my sonhand presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to mrs  . weston  . she is his principal correspondentassure you  .hardly ever getletter  . and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr  . weston -- laughing affectedlymust protest against that  .--most dangerous precedent indeed --beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example  .-- upon my word if this is whatam to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves -- oh mr  . westoncould not have believed it of you aye we men are sad fellows  . you must take care of yourself mrs  . elton  .-- this letter tells us -- it isshort letter -- written inhurry merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs  . churchillaccount -- she has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time  . indeed -- from yorkshirethink  . enscombe is in yorkshire yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london  .considerable journey  . yes upon my word very considerable  . sixty - five miles farther than from maple grove to london  . but what is distance mr  . weston to people of large fortune -- you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr  . suckling sometimes flies about  . you will hardly believe me -- but twice in one week he and mr  . bragge went to london and back again with four horses  . the evil of the distance from enscombe said mr  . weston is that mrs  . churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the sofa forweek together  . in franklast letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his unclethis you know speaksgreat degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road  .-- so frank writes word  . certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs  . elton  . you must grant me that  . no indeedshall grant you nothing  .always take the part of my own sex  .do indeed  .give you notice -- you will find meformidable antagonist on that point  .always stand up for women -- andassure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs  . churchillmaking incredible exertions to avoid it  . selina says it is quite horror to her -- andbelievehave caughtlittle of her nicety  . she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution  . does mrs  . churchill do the same depend upon it mrs  . churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did  . mrs  . churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for -- mrs  . elton eagerly interposed with oh mr  . weston do not mistake me  . selina is no fine ladyassure you  . do not run away with such an idea  . is not she then she is no rule for mrs  . churchill who is as thoroughfine lady as any body ever beheld  . mrs  . elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly  . it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was notfine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it -- and she was considering in what way she had best retract when mr  . weston went on  . mrs  . churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect -- but this is quite between ourselves  . she is very fond of frank and thereforewould not speak ill of her  . besides she is out of health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been  .would not say so to every body mrs  . elton buthave not much faith in mrs  . churchillillness  . if she is really ill why not go to bath mr  . weston -- to bath or to clifton she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her  . the fact issuppose that she is tired of enscombe  . she has now beenlonger time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change  . it isretired place  .fine place but very retired  . aye -- like maple grovedare say  . nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove  . such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement  .-- and mrs  . churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion  . or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified forcountry life  .always saywoman cannot have too many resources -- andfeel very thankful thathave so many myself as to be quite independent of society  . frank was here in february forfortnight  . soremember to have heard  . he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again that is ifmay presume to call myself an addition  . but perhaps he may never have heard of there being suchcreature in the world  . this was too loudcall forcompliment to be passed by and mr  . weston withvery good grace immediately exclaimed my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine suchthing possible  . not heard of you --believe mrs  . westonletters lately have been full of very little else than mrs  . elton  . he had done his duty and could return to his son  . when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this daynews doubly welcome  . it has been completely unexpected  . that isalways hadstrong persuasion he would be here again soonwas sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me  . he and mrs  . weston were both dreadfully desponding  . how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth --always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see  .have observed mrs  . elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next  . very true mr  . weston perfectly true  . it is just whatused to say tocertain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymensaffron robe would be put on for us  . oh the painshave been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views the carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage -- one morningremember he came to me quite in despair  . she was stopped byslight fit of coughing and mr  . weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on  . you were mentioning may  . may is the very month which mrs  . churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe -- in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring -- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise  . when he was here before we made the best of it but there wasgood deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended  . now will be the time  . this will be complete enjoyment anddo not know mrs  . elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house  .think it is so  .think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight  .hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expectprodigy  . he is generally thoughtfine young man but do not expectprodigy  . mrs  . westonpartiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me  . she thinks nobody equal to him  . andassure you mr  . westonhave very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour  .have heard so much in praise of mr  . frank churchill  .-- at the same time it is fair to observe thatam one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others  .give you notice that asfind your son soshall judge of him  .--am no flatterer  . mr  . weston was musing  .hope said he presentlyhave not been severe upon poor mrs  . churchill  . if she is illshould be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearancecould wish  . you cannot be ignorant mrs  . elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatmenthave met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her  . she was the instigator  . frankmother would never have been slighted as she was but for her  . mr  . churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wifehis isquiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himselflittle helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood  . she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter ofgentleman but ever since her being turned intochurchill she has out - churchillthem all in high and mighty claims but in herselfassure you she is an upstart  . only think well that must be infinitely provokinghave quitehorror of upstarts  . maple grove has given methorough disgust to people of that sort for there isfamily in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves your description of mrs  . churchill made me think of them directly  . people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be onfooting with the old established families  .year andhalf is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows  . they came from birmingham which is notplace to promise much you know mr  . weston  . one has not great hopes from birmingham  .always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans thoughgood many thingsassure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr  . suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours  . it is infinitely too bad  . mr  . suckling who has been eleven yearsresident at maple grove and whose father had it before him --believe at least --am almost sure that old mr  . suckling had completed the purchase before his death  . they were interrupted  . tea was carrying round and mr  . weston having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away  . after tea mr  . and mrs  . weston and mr  . elton sat down with mr  . woodhouse to cards  . the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr  . knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mrs  . elton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself inworry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent  . mr  . john knightley proved more talkative than his brother  . he was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with -- well emmado not believehave any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sisterletter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure  . my charge would be much more concise than herand probably not much in the same spirit all thathave to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them  .rather hope to satisfy you both said emma forshall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic  . and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again  . that is very likely  . you think so do not youhopeam aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately  . increase certainly you must be sensible that the last half - year has madegreat difference in your way of life  . difference no indeedam not  . there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be  . witness this very time  . here amcome down for only one day and you are engaged withdinner - party -- when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it  .little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr  . coleor balls at the crown  . the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings - on is very great  . yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all  . very well -- and as randallssuppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me aspossible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way  . and if they areonly beg you to send them home  . no cried mr  . knightley that need not be the consequence  . let them be sent to donwell  .shall certainly be at leisure  . upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse meshould like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and whyam to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys  . these amazing engagements of mine -- what have they been dining once with the coles -- and havingball talked of which never took place  .can understand you -- nodding at mr  . john knightley -- your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed  . but you turning to mr  . knightley who know how very very seldomam ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee suchseries of dissipation for mecannot imagine  . and as to my dear little boysmust say that if aunt emma has not time for themdo not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one -- and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts  . mr  . knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded without difficulty upon mrs  . eltonbeginning to talk to him  . volume iii chaptera very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill  . she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him  . her own attachment had really subsided intomere nothing it was not worth thinking of -- but if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away it would be very distressing  . ifseparation of two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before her -- caution for him and for herself would be necessary  . she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his  . she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration  . that would be so very painfulconclusion of their present acquaintance and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive  . she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringingcrisis an eventsomething to alter her present composed and tranquil state  . it was not very long though rather longer than mr  . weston had foreseen before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchillfeelings  . the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards  . he rode down forcouple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act  . they met with the utmost friendliness  . there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her  . but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree  . she watched him well  . it wasclear thing he was less in love than he had been  . absence with the conviction probably of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable effect  . he was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories and he was not without agitation  . it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference  . he was not calm his spirits were evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him  . lively as he was it seemedliveliness that did not satisfy himself but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying onlyquarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury  . he had seengroup of old acquaintance in the street as he passed -- he had not stopped he would not stop for more thanword -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off  . she had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed likeperfect cure and she was rather inclined to think it implieddread of her returning power anddiscreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long  . this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days  . he was often hoping intending to come -- but was always prevented  . his aunt could not bear to have him leave her  . such was his own account at randall . if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was to be inferred that mrs  . churchillremoval to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder  . that she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself convinced of it at randalls  . though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked back that she was inweaker state of health than she had been halfyear ago  . he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her but he could not be prevailed on by all his fatherdoubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong as ever  . it soon appeared that london was not the place for her  . she could not endure its noise  . her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days end her nephewletter to randalls communicatedchange of plan  . they were going to remove immediately to richmond  . mrs  . churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwisefancy for the place  .ready - furnished house infavourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change  . emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for may and june  . she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish  . emma saw how mr  . weston understood these joyous prospects  . he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered  . she hoped it was not so  . two months must bring it to the proof  . mr  . westonown happiness was indisputable  . he was quite delighted  . it was the very circumstance he could have wished for  . now it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood  . what were nine miles toyoung man -- an hourride  . he would be always coming over  . the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never  . sixteen miles -- nay eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to manchester - street -- wasserious obstacle  . were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning  . there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse  . better than nearer one good thing was immediately brought tocertainty by this removal -- the ball at the crown  . it had not been forgotten before but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fixday  . now however it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmondfew lines from frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time induced them to name as earlyday as possible  . mr  . westonball was to bereal thing  .very few to - morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness  . mr  . woodhouse was resigned  . the time of year lightened the evil to him  . may was better for every thing than february  . mrs  . bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone  . chapter ii no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball  . the day approached the day arrived and aftermorning of some anxious watching frank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before dinner and every thing was safe  . no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma  . the room at the crown was to witness it -- but it would be better thancommon meeting incrowd  . mr  . weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young mancompany  . she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just sufficiently before them  . frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though he did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to havedelightful evening  . they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and withinfew minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize  . so unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it wasfamily of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr  . westonjudgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection  . emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr  . weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate ofman who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity  . she liked his open manners butlittle less of open - heartedness would have made himhigher character  .-- general benevolence but not general friendship mademan what he ought to be  .-- she could fancy suchman  . the whole party walked about and looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do formedsort of half - circle round the fire to observe in their various modes till other subjects were started that though mayfire in the evening was still very pleasant  . emma found that it was not mr  . westonfault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger  . they had stopped at mrs  . batesdoor to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons  . frank was standing by her but not steadily there wasrestlessness which shewedmind not at ease  . he was looking about he was going to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages -- impatient to begin or afraid of being always near her  . mrs  . elton was spoken of  .think she must be here soon said he  .havegreat curiosity to see mrs  . eltonhave heard so much of her  . it cannot be longthink before she comes  .carriage was heard  . he was on the move immediately but coming back saidam forgetting thatam not acquainted with her  .have never seen either mr  . or mrs  . elton  .have no business to put myself forward  . mr  . and mrs  . elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed  . but miss bates and miss fairfax said mr  . weston looking about  . we thought you were to bring them  . the mistake had been slight  . the carriage was sent for them now  . emma longed to know what frankfirst opinion of mrs  . elton might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of graciousness  . he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed  . infew minutes the carriage returned  .-- somebody talked of rain  .--will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father miss bates must not be forgotten and away he went  . mr  . weston was following but mrs  . elton detained him to gratify him by her opinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing  .very fine young man indeed mr  . weston  . you knowcandidly told youshould form my own opinion andam happy to say thatam extremely pleased with him  .-- you may believe me  .never compliment  .think himvery handsome young man and his manners are precisely whatlike and approve -- so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism  . you must knowhavevast dislike to puppies -- quitehorror of them  . they were never tolerated at maple grove  . neither mr  . suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost tofault bore with them much better  . while she talked of his son mr  . westonattention was chained but when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away  . mrs  . elton turned to mrs  . weston  .have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane  . our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious --believe we drive faster than any body  .-- whatpleasure it is to send onecarriage forfriend --understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary  . you may be very sureshall always take care of them  . miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room and mrs  . elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs  . westonto receive them  . her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma but her words every bodywords were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire  . as the door opened she was heard so very obliging of you -- no rain at all  . nothing to signify  .do not care for myself  . quite thick shoes  . and jane declares -- well -- as soon as she was within the door well this is brilliant indeed -- this is admirable -- excellently contrived upon my word  . nothing wanting  . could not have imagined it  .-- so well lighted up -- jane jane look -- did you ever see any thing oh mr  . weston you must really have had aladdinlamp  . good mrs  . stokes would not know her own room again  .saw her ascame in she was standing in the entrance  . oh mrs  . stokes said-- buthad not time for more  . she was now met by mrs  . weston  .-- very wellthank you ma am  .hope you are quite well  . very happy to hear it  . so afraid you might haveheadache -- seeing you pass by so often and knowing how much trouble you must have  . delighted to hear it indeed  . ah dear mrs  . elton so obliged to you for the carriage -- excellent time  . jane andquite ready  . did not keep the horsesmoment  . most comfortable carriage  .-- oh andam sure our thanks are due to you mrs  . weston on that score  . mrs  . elton had most kindly sent janenote or we should have been  .-- but two such offers in one day -- never were such neighbours  .said to my mother upon my word ma am -- . thank you my mother is remarkably well  . gone to mr  . woodhouse .made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- mrs  . dixonwedding - present  .-- so kind of her to think of my mother bought at weymouth you know -- mr  . dixonchoice  . there were three others jane says which they hesitated about some time  . colonel campbell rather preferred an olive  . my dear jane are you sure you did not wet your feet -- it was butdrop or two butam so afraid -- but mr  . frank churchill was so extremely -- and there wasmat to step upon --shall never forget his extreme politeness  .-- oh mr  . frank churchillmust tell you my motherspectacles have never been in fault since the rivet never came out again  . my mother often talks of your good - nature  . does not she jane -- do not we often talk of mr  . frank churchill -- ah heremiss woodhouse  .-- dear miss woodhouse how do you do -- very wellthank you quite well  . this is meeting quite in fairy - land -- suchtransformation -- must not complimentknow eyeing emma most complacently -- that would be rude -- but upon my word miss woodhouse you do look -- how do you like janehair -- you arejudge  .-- she did it all herself  . quite wonderful how she does her hair -- no hairdresser from londonthink could  .-- ah dr  . hughesdeclare -- and mrs  . hughes  . must go and speak to dr  . and mrs  . hughes formoment  .-- how do you do how do you do -- very wellthank you  . this is delightful is not it -- wheredear mr  . richard -- oh there he is  . dondisturb him  . much better employed talking to the young ladies  . how do you do mr  . richard --saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- mrs  . otwayprotest -- and good mr  . otway and miss otway and miss caroline  .-- suchhost of friends -- and mr  . george and mr  . arthur -- how do you do how do you all do -- quite wellam much obliged to you  . never better  .-- doni hear another carriage -- who can this be -- very likely the worthy coles  .-- upon my word this is charming to be standing about among such friends and suchnoble fire --am quite roasted  . no coffeethank you for me -- never take coffee  .--little tea if you please sir by and bye -- no hurry -- oh here it comes  . every thing so good frank churchill returned to his station by emma and as soon as miss bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs  . elton and miss fairfax who were standinglittle way behind her  .-- he was thoughtful  . whether he were overhearing too she could not determine  . aftergood many compliments to jane on her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken mrs  . elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was how do you like my gown -- how do you like my trimming -- how has wright done my hair -- with many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness  . mrs  . elton then said nobody can think less of dress in general thando -- but upon such an occasion as this when every bodyeyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westons -- whohave no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour --would not wish to be inferior to others  . andsee very few pearls in the room except mine  .-- so frank churchill iscapital dancerunderstand  .-- we shall see if our styles suit  .--fine young man certainly is frank churchill  .like him very well  . at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear more -- and the voices of the ladies were drowned forwhile till another suspension brought mrs  . eltontones again distinctly forward  .-- mr  . elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming oh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion --was this moment telling janethought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us  . jane -- repeated frank churchill withlook of surprize and displeasure  .-- that is easy -- but miss fairfax does not disapprove itsuppose  . how do you like mrs  . elton said emma inwhisper  . not at all  . you are ungrateful  . ungrateful -- what do you mean then changing fromfrown tosmile -- no do not tell me --do not want to know what you mean  .-- where is my father -- when are we to begin dancing emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour  . he walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both mr  . and mrs  . weston  . he had met with them inlittle perplexity which must be laid before emma  . it had just occurred to mrs  . weston that mrs  . elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction  .-- emma heard the sad truth with fortitude  . and what are we to do forproper partner for her said mr  . weston  . she will think frank ought to ask her  . frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that mrs  . weston was wanting him to dance with mrs  . elton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon  .-- mr  . weston and mrs  . elton led the way mr  . frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed  . emma must submit to stand second to mrs  . elton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her  . it was almost enough to make her think of marrying  . mrs  . elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could not lose by the change  . mr  . weston might be his sonsuperior  .-- in spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her  .-- she was more disturbed by mr  . knightleynot dancing than by any thing else  .-- there he was among the standers - by where he ought not to be he ought to be dancing -- not classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whist - players who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up -- so young as he looked -- he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself  . his tall firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every bodyeyes and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him  .-- he movedfew steps nearer and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlikemanner with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the trouble  .-- whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile but in general he was looking grave  . she wished he could loveballroom better and could like frank churchill better  .-- he seemed often observing her  . she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid  . there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner  . they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers  . that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable  . the ball proceeded pleasantly  . the anxious cares the incessant attentions of mrs  . weston were not thrown away  . every body seemed happy and the praise of beingdelightful ball which is seldom bestowed till afterball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this  . of very important very recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually are  . there was one however which emma thought something of  .-- the two last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partner -- the only young lady sitting down -- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder -- but emmawonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr  . elton sauntering about  . he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room  . escape however was not his plan  . he came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it  . he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her  .-- emma saw it  . she was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her headlittle she saw it all  . when she was half - way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr  . elton was so near that she heard every syllable ofdialogue which just then took place between him and mrs  . weston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances  .-- the kind - hearted gentle mrs  . weston had left her seat to join him and say do not you dance mr  . elton to which his prompt reply was most readily mrs  . weston if you will dance with me  . me -- oh no --would get youbetter partner than myself  .am no dancer  . if mrs  . gilbert wishes to dance said heshall have great pleasuream sure -- for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs  . gilbert  . mrs  . gilbert does not mean to dance but there isyoung lady disengaged whomshould be very glad to see dancing -- miss smith  . miss smith -- oh --had not observed  .-- you are extremely obliging -- and ifwere not an old married man  .-- but my dancing days are over mrs  . weston  . you will excuse me  . any thing elseshould be most happy to do at your command -- but my dancing days are over  . mrs  . weston said no more and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat  . this was mr  . elton the amiable obliging gentle mr  . elton  .-- she looked round formoment he had joined mr  . knightley atlittle distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife  . she would not look again  . her heart was inglow and she feared her face might be as hot  . in another momenthappier sight caught her -- mr  . knightley leading harriet to the set -- never had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant  . she was all pleasure and gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again  . his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced  . it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was incontinual course of smiles  . mr  . elton had retreated into the card - room looking emma trusted very foolish  . she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like her -- she spoke some of her feelings by observing audibly to her partner knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith -- very goodnatureddeclare  . supper was announced  . the move began and miss bates might be heard from that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon  . jane jane my dear jane where are you -- here is your tippet  . mrs  . weston begs you to put on your tippet  . she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done -- one door nailed up -- quantities of matting -- my dear jane indeed you must  . mr  . churchill oh you are too obliging how well you put it on -- so gratified excellent dancing indeed -- yes my dearran home assaidshould to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me  .--set off without sayingword just astold you  . grandmama was quite well hadcharming evening with mr  . woodhousevast deal of chat and backgammon  .-- tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquiredgreat deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners  . oh saidi shall not forestall janeleft her dancing with mr  . george otway she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow her first partner was mr  . eltondo not know who will ask her next perhaps mr  . william cox  . my dear sir you are too obliging  .-- is there nobody you would not rather --am not helpless  . sir you are most kind  . upon my word jane on one arm and me on the other -- stop stop let us standlittle back mrs  . elton is going dear mrs  . elton how elegant she looks -- beautiful lace -- now we all follow in her train  . quite the queen of the evening -- well here we are at the passage  . two steps jane take care of the two steps  . oh no there is but one  . wellwas persuaded there were two  . how very oddwas convinced there were two and there is but one  .never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- candles everywhere  .--was telling you of your grandmama jane -- there waslittle disappointment  .-- the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there wasdelicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr  . woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again  . now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concerned -- well this is brilliantam all amazement could not have supposed any thing -- such elegance and profusion --have seen nothing like it since -- well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that jane is not indraught  . wheresit is of no consequence  . oh do you recommend this side -- wellam sure mr  . churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please  . what you direct in this house cannot be wrong  . dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless meshould not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent andcannot help beginning  . emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr  . knightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked  . he was warm in his reprobation of mr  . eltonconduct it had been unpardonable rudeness and mrs  . eltonlooks also received the due share of censure  . they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he  . emma why is it that they are your enemies he looked with smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added she ought not to be angry with yoususpect whatever he may be  .-- to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet  .did replied emma and they cannot forgive me  . he shook his head but there wassmile of indulgence with it and he only saidshall not scold you  .leave you to your own reflections  . can you trust me with such flatterers -- does my vain spirit ever tell meam wrong not your vain spirit but your serious spirit  .-- if one leads you wrongam sure the other tells you of it  .do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr  . elton  . there islittleness about him which you discovered and whichdid not andwas fully convinced of his being in love with harriet  . it was throughseries of strange blunders and in return for your acknowledging so muchwill do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself  .-- harriet smith has some first - rate qualities which mrs  . elton is totally without  . an unpretending single - minded artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to suchwoman as mrs  . elton  .found harriet more conversable thanexpected  . emma was extremely gratified  .-- they were interrupted by the bustle of mr  . weston calling on every body to begin dancing again  . come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing -- come emma set your companions the example  . every body is lazy every body is asleepam ready said emma wheneveram wanted  . whom are you going to dance with asked mr  . knightley  . she hesitatedmoment and then replied with you if you will ask me  . will you said he offering his hand  . indeedwill  . you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper  . brother and sister no indeed  . chapter iii this little explanation with mr  . knightley gave emma considerable pleasure  . it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy  .-- she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying  . the impertinence of the eltons which forfew minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of harrietinfatuation  .-- from harrietmanner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes  . it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr  . elton was not the superior creature she had believed him  . the fever was over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy  . she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite  .-- harriet rational frank churchill not too much in love and mr  . knightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happysummer must be before her she was not to see frank churchill this morning  . he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day  . she did not regret it  . having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa when the great iron sweep - gate opened and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- frank churchill with harriet leaning on his arm -- actually harriet --moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened  . harriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her  .-- the iron gates and the front - door were not twenty yards asunder -- they were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking intochair fainted away  .young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered and surprizes be explained  . such events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long  .few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole  . miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at mrs  . goddardwho had been also at the ball had walked out together and takenroad the richmond road which though apparently public enough for safety had led them into alarm  .-- about halfmile beyond highbury makingsudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became forconsiderable stretch very retired and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived atsmall distance before them onbroader patch of greensward by the sideparty of gipsies  .child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton excessively frightened gavegreat scream and calling on harriet to follow her ran upsteep bank clearedslight hedge at the top and made the best of her way byshort cut back to highbury  . but poor harriet could not follow  . she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on suchreturn of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain  . how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by halfdozen children headed bystout woman andgreat boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word  .-- more and more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave themshilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill  .-- she was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang demanding more  . in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling and conditioning they loud and insolent  . bymost fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment  . the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another roadmile or two beyond highbury -- and happening to have borrowedpair of scissors the night before of miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in forfew minutes he was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them  . the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion  . he had left them completely frightened and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome  . it was his idea to bring her to hartfield he had thought of no other place  . this was the amount of the whole story -- of his communication and of harrietas soon as she had recovered her senses and speech  .-- he dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays left him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs  . goddard and notice of there being suchset of people in the neighbourhood to mr  . knightley he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself  . such an adventure as this --fine young man andlovely young woman thrown together in suchway could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain  . so emma thought at least  . couldlinguist couldgrammarian could evenmathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other -- how much more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and foresight -- especially with suchgroundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made  . it wasvery extraordinary thing nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory no rencontre no alarm of the kind -- and now it had happened to the very person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her -- it certainly was very extraordinary -- and knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this period it struck her the more  . he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for mr  . elton  . it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences  . it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other  . in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror her naivete her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm withsensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harrietown account had been given he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms  . every thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted  . she would not stirstep nor drophint  . no she had had enough of interference  . there could be no harm inschememere passive scheme  . it was no more thanwish  . beyond it she would on no account proceed  . emmafirst resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed -- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible  . within half an hour it was known all over highbury  . it was the very event to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news  . the last nightball seemed lost in the gipsies  . poor mr  . woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again  . it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent -- which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with  . she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of suchman for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not invent illnesses for her she could make no figure inmessage  . the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off inhurry  . the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history dwindled soon intomatter of little importance but to emma and her nephews -- in her imagination it maintained its ground and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital  . chapter ivvery few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one morning to emma withsmall parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began miss woodhouse -- if you are at leisure --have something thatshould like to tell you --sort of confession to make -- and then you know it will be over  . emma wasgood deal surprized but begged her to speak  . there wasseriousness in harrietmanner which prepared her quite as much as her words for something more than ordinary  . it is my duty andam sure it is my wish she continued to have no reserves with you on this subject  . asam happily quite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it  .do not want to say more than is necessary --am too much ashamed of having given way ashave done anddare say you understand me  . yes said emmahopedo  . howcould so longtime be fancying myself  .  .  . cried harriet warmly  . it seems like madnesscan see nothing at all extraordinary in him now  .--do not care whethermeet him or not -- except that of the twohad rather not see him -- and indeedwould go any distance round to avoid him -- butdo not envy his wife in the leastneither admire her nor envy her ashave done she is very charmingdare say and all that butthink her very ill - tempered and disagreeable --shall never forget her look the other night -- howeverassure you miss woodhousewish her no evil  .-- no let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another momentpang and to convince you thathave been speaking trutham now going to destroy -- whatought to have destroyed long ago -- whatought never to have kept --know that very well blushing as she spoke  .-- however nowwill destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rationalam grown  . cannot you guess what this parcel holds said she withconscious look  . not the least in the world  .-- did he ever give you any thing no --cannot call them gifts but they are things thathave valued very much  . she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most precious treasures on the top  . her curiosity was greatly excited  . harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience  . within abundance of silver paper waspretty little tunbridge - ware box which harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton emma saw onlysmall piece of court - plaister  . now said harriet you must recollect  . no indeeddo not  . dear meshould not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it -- it was butvery few days beforehad my sore throat -- just before mr  . and mrs  . john knightley came --think the very evening  .-- do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court - plaister -- but as you had none about you and knewhad you desired me to supply him and sotook mine out and cut himpiece but it wasgreat deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me  . and so then in my nonsensecould not help makingtreasure of it -- soput it by never to be used and looked at it now and then asgreat treat  . my dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself thancan bear  . remember it ayeremember it all now all except your saving this relic --knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger and my recommending court - plaister and sayinghad none about me -- oh my sins my sins -- andhad plenty all the while in my pocket -- one of my senseless tricks --deserve to be undercontinual blush all the rest of my life  .-- well -- sitting down again -- go on -- what else and had you really some at hand yourselfam surenever suspected it you did it so naturally  . and so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement  . and secretly she added to herself lord bless me when shouldever have thought of putting by in cottonpiece of court - plaister that frank churchill had been pulling aboutnever was equal to this  . here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is something still more valuablemean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court - plaister never did  . emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure  . it was the end of an old pencil -- the part without any lead  . this was really his said harriet  .-- do not you remember one morning -- nodare say you do not  . but one morning --forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to makememorandum in his pocket - book it was about spruce - beer  . mr  . knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing  . butkept my eye on it and as soon asdared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment  .do remember it cried emmaperfectly remember it  .-- talking about spruce - beer  .-- oh yes -- mr  . knightley andboth saying we liked it and mr  . eltonseeming resolved to learn to like it too  .perfectly remember it  .-- stop mr  . knightley was standing just here was not hehave an idea he was standing just here  . ahdo not know  .cannot recollect  .-- it is very odd butcannot recollect  .-- mr  . elton was sitting hereremember much about wheream now  . -- well go on  . oh thatall  .have nothing more to shew you or to say -- except thatam now going to throw them both behind the fire andwish you to see me do it  . my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things yes simpleton aswas -- butam quite ashamed of it now and wishcould forget as easily ascan burn them  . it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married  .knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them  . but harriet is it necessary to burn the court - plaister --have notword to say for the bit of old pencil but the court - plaister might be useful  .shall be happier to burn it replied harriet  . it hasdisagreeable look to me  .must get rid of every thing  .-- there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr  . elton  . and when thought emma will there bebeginning of mr  . churchill she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had told no fortune might be proved to have made harriet .-- aboutfortnight after the alarm they came tosufficient explanation and quite undesignedly  . emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the information she received more valuable  . she merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet whenever you marrywould advise you to do so and so -- and thought no more of it till afterminutesilence she heard harriet say invery serious toneshall never marry  . emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and aftermomentdebate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied never marry -- this isnew resolution  . it is one thatshall never change however  . after another short hesitationhope it does not proceed from --hope it is not in compliment to mr  . elton mr  . elton indeed cried harriet indignantly  .-- oh no -- and emma could just catch the words so superior to mr  . elton she then tooklonger time for consideration  . should she proceed no farther -- should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing -- perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved  .-- she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once all that she meant to say and know  . plain dealing was always best  . she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any application of the sort and it would be safer for both to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed  .-- she was decided and thus spoke -- harrietwill not affect to be in doubt of your meaning  . your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you  . is not it so oh miss woodhouse believe mehave not the presumption to suppose -- indeedam not so mad  .-- but it ispleasure to me to admire him atdistance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially  .am not at all surprized at you harriet  . the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart  . service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation -- the very recollection of it and all thatfelt at the time -- whensaw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before  . suchchange in one moment suchchange from perfect misery to perfect happiness it is very natural  . it is natural and it is honourable  .-- yes honourablethink to chuse so well and so gratefully  .-- but that it will befortunate preference is more thatcan promise  .do not advise you to give way to it harriet  .do not by any means engage for its being returned  . consider what you are about  . perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you  . be observant of him  . let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations  .give you this caution now becauseshall never speak to you again on the subject  .am determined against all interference  . henceforwardknow nothing of the matter  . let no name ever pass our lips  . we were very wrong before we will be cautious now  .-- he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles ofvery serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity  . but take care of yourself  .would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him ismark of good taste whichshall always know how to value  . harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude  . emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend  . its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation  . chapterin this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon hartfield  . to highbury in general it brought no material change  . the eltons were still talking ofvisit from the sucklings and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau and jane fairfax was still at her grandmotherand as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat mrs  . eltonactivity in her service and save herself from being hurried intodelightful situation against her will  . mr  . knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike him more  . he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma  . that emma was his object appeared indisputable  . every thing declared it his own attentions his fatherhints his mother - in - lawguarded silence it was all in unison words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story  . but while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet mr  . knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax  . he could not understand it but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emmaerrors of imagination  . she was not present when the suspicion first arose  . he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had seenlook more thansingle look at miss fairfax which from the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place  . when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight myself creating whatsaw brought him yet stronger suspicion of there beingsomething of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane  . he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at hartfield  . emma and harriet were going to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in withlarger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain mr  . and mrs  . weston and their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met  . they all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him  . the randalls party agreed to it immediately and afterpretty long speech from miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhousemost obliging invitation  . as they were turning into the grounds mr  . perry passed by on horseback  . the gentlemen spoke of his horse  . by the bye said frank churchill to mrs  . weston presently what became of mr  . perryplan of setting up his carriage mrs  . weston looked surprized and saiddid not know that he ever had any such plan  . nayhad it from you  . you wrote me word of it three months ago  . me impossible indeed you did  .remember it perfectly  . you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon  . mrs  . perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it  . it was owing to her persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did himgreat deal of harm  . you must remember it now upon my wordnever heard of it till this moment  . never really never -- bless me how could it be -- thenmust have dreamt it -- butwas completely persuaded -- miss smith you walk as if you were tired  . you will not be sorry to find yourself at home  . what is this -- what is this cried mr  . weston about perry andcarriage is perry going to set up his carriage frankam glad he can afford it  . you had it from himself had you no sir replied his son laughingseem to have had it from nobody  .-- very odd --really was persuaded of mrs  . westonhaving mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heardsyllable of it before of course it must have beendream  .amgreat dreamer  .dream of every body at highbury whenam away -- and whenhave gone through my particular friends thenbegin dreaming of mr  . and mrs  . perry  . it is odd though observed his father that you should have had suchregular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe  . perrysetting up his carriage and his wifepersuading him to it out of care for his health -- just what will happenhave no doubt some time or other onlylittle premature  . what an air of probability sometimes runs throughdream and at others whatheap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent  . emma you aregreat dreamerthink emma was out of hearing  . she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of mr  . westonhint  . why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes ifmust speak on this subject there is no denying that mr  . frank churchill might have --do not mean to say that he did not dream it --am surehave sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but ifam questioned about itmust acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs  . perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quitesecret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days  . mrs  . perry was very anxious that he should havecarriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed  . jane donyou remember grandmamatelling us of it when we got homeforget where we had been walking to -- very likely to randalls yesthink it was to randalls  . mrs  . perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeeddo not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to thisnever mentioned it tosoul thatknow of  . at the same timewill not positively answer for my having never dropthint becauseknowdo sometimes pop outthing befoream aware  .amtalker you knowam rathertalker and now and thenhave letthing escape me whichshould not  .am not like janewishwere  .will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world  . where is she -- oh just behind  . perfectly remember mrs  . perrycoming  .-- extraordinary dream indeed they were entering the hall  . mr  . knightleyeyes had preceded miss batesinglance at jane  . from frank churchillface where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl  . mr  . weston had walked in  . the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass  . mr  . knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain however if it were so -- jane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither  . there was no time for farther remark or explanation  . the dream must be borne with and mr  . knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the small - sized pembroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded  . tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed inhurry to move  . miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examiningtable behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters it used to stand here  . where is it this issort of dull - looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer  . we had great amusement with those letters one morning  .want to puzzle you again  . emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves  . they were rapidly forming words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled  . the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr  . woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort which mr  . weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it  . frank churchill placedword before miss fairfax  . she gaveslight glance round the table and applied herself to it  . frank was next to emma jane opposite to them -- and mr  . knightley so placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little apparent observation  . the word was discovered and withfaint smile pushed away  . if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to work  . she was sitting by mr  . knightley and turned to him for help  . the word was blunder and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there wasblush on janecheek which gave itmeaning not otherwise ostensible  . mr  . knightley connected it with the dream but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension  . how the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep he feared there must be some decided involvement  . disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn  . these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick  . it waschildplay chosen to concealdeeper game on frank churchillpart  . with great indignation did he continue to observe him with great alarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions  . he sawshort word prepared for emma and given to her withlook sly and demure  . he saw that emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure for she said nonsense for shame he heard frank churchill next say withglance towards janewill give it to her -- shall-- and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth  . no no you must not you shall not indeed  . it was done however  . this gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fairfax and withparticular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it  . mr  . knightleyexcessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it to be dixon  . jane fairfaxperception seemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters so arranged  . she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying onlydid not know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered  . her face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned towards her aunt  . aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not spokenword --was just going to say the same thing  . it is time for us to be going indeed  . the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us  . my dear sir you are too obliging  . we really must wish you good night  . janealertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived  . she was immediately up and wanting to quit the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away and mr  . knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined  . she was afterwards looking for her shawl -- frank churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted mr  . knightley could not tell  . he remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full of what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist his observations he must -- yes he certainly must asfriend -- an anxious friend -- give emma some hint ask her some question  . he could not see her insituation of such danger without trying to preserve her  . it was his duty  . pray emma said he mayask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfaxsaw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other  . emma was extremely confused  . she could not endure to give him the true explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them  . oh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothingmere joke among ourselves  . the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and mr  . churchill  . he had hoped she would speak again but she did not  . she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak  . he satlittle while in doubt  .variety of evils crossed his mind  . interference -- fruitless interference  . emmaconfusion and the acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare her affection engaged  . yet he would speak  . he owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter any thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in suchcause  . my dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of between mr  . frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly  .-- why do you makedoubt of it have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him never never she cried withmost open eagerness -- never for the twentieth part ofmoment did such an idea occur to me  . and how could it possibly come into your headhave lately imagined thatsaw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks whichdid not believe meant to be public  . oh you amuse me excessively  .am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do  . there is no admiration between themdo assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather oftotally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain -- there isgood deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be  . that ispresume it to be so on her side andcan answer for its being so on his  .will answer for the gentlemanindifference  . she spoke withconfidence which staggered withsatisfaction which silenced mr  . knightley  . she was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows ofcircumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers  . he found he could not be useful and his feelings were too much irritated for talking  . that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever by the fire which mr  . woodhousetender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards tookhasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey  . chapter vi after being long fed with hopes ofspeedy visit from mr  . and mrs  . suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn  . no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present  . in the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted to the other topics with which forwhile the sucklings coming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs  . churchill whose health seemed every day to supplydifferent report and the situation of mrs  . weston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival ofchild as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it  . mrs  . elton was very much disappointed  . it was the delay ofgreat deal of pleasure and parade  . her introductions and recommendations must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of  . so she thought at first -- butlittle consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off  . why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come they could go there again with them in the autumn  . it was settled that they should go to box hill  . that there was to be suchparty had been long generally known it had even given the idea of another  . emma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and mr  . weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither  . two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done inquiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings  . this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but feel some surprise andlittle displeasure on hearing from mr  . weston that he had been proposing to mrs  . elton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as mrs  . elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection  . now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs  . elton of which mr  . weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward again -- it could not be done withoutreproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have donegreat deal to avoid an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs  . eltonparty every feeling was offended and the forbearance of her outward submission leftheavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr  . westontemper  .am glad you approve of whathave done said he very comfortably  . butthought you would  . such schemes as these are nothing without numbers  . one cannot have too largeparty  .large party secures its own amusement  . and she isgood - natured woman after all  . one could not leave her out  . emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private  . it was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs  . elton was growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr  . weston as to pigeon - pies and cold lamb whenlame carriage - horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty  . it might be weeks it might be onlyfew days before the horse were useable but no preparations could be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation  . mrs  . eltonresources were inadequate to such an attack  . is not this most vexations knightley she cried  .-- and such weather for exploring -- these delays and disappointments are quite odious  . what are we to do -- the year will wear away at this rate and nothing done  . before this time last yearassure you we had haddelightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston  . you had better explore to donwell replied mr  . knightley  . that may be done without horses  . come and eat my strawberries  . they are ripening fast  . if mr  . knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so for his proposal was caught at with delight and the ohshould like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner  . donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds which seemedplea for the invitation but no plea was necessary cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere  . she promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by suchproof of intimacy suchdistinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it  . you may depend upon me said she  .certainly will come  . name your day andwill come  . you will allow me to bring jane fairfaxcannot nameday said he tillhave spoken to some others whomwould wish to meet you  . oh leave all that to me  . only give mecarte - blanche  .--am lady patroness you know  . it is my party  .will bring friends with me  .hope you will bring elton said he butwill not trouble you to give any other invitations  . oh now you are looking very sly  . but consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to me  .am no young lady on her preferment  . married women you know may be safely authorised  . it is my party  . leave it all to me  .will invite your guests  . no -- he calmly replied -- there is but one married woman in the world whomcan ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is -- -- mrs  . westonsuppose interrupted mrs  . elton rather mortified  . no -- mrs  . knightley -- and till she is in beingwill manage such matters myself  . ah you are an odd creature she cried satisfied to have no one preferred to herself  .-- you arehumourist and may say what you like  . quitehumourist  . wellshall bring jane with me -- jane and her aunt  .-- the restleave to you  .have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family  . donscruple  .know you are attached to them  . you certainly will meet them ifcan prevail andshall call on miss bates in my way home  . thatquite unnecessarysee jane every day -- but as you like  . it is to bemorning scheme you know knightley quitesimple thing  .shall wearlarge bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm  . here -- probably this basket with pink ribbon  . nothing can be more simple you see  . and jane will have such another  . there is to be no form or parade --sort of gipsy party  . we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees -- and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doors --table spread in the shade you know  . every thing as natural and simple as possible  . is not that your idea not quite  . my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room  . the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniturethink is best observed by meals within doors  . when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house  . well -- as you please only donhavegreat set out  . and by the bye canor my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion -- pray be sincere knightley  . if you wish me to talk to mrs  . hodges or to inspect anything --have not the least wish for itthank you  . well -- but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever  .will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any bodyassistance  .wish we haddonkey  . the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys jane miss bates and me -- and my caro sposo walking by  .really must talk to him about purchasingdonkey  . incountry lifeconceive it to besort of necessary for letwoman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home -- and very long walks you know -- in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt  . you will not find either between donwell and highbury  . donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry  . come ondonkey however if you prefer it  . you can borrow mrs  . cole .would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible  . thatam sure you would  . indeeddo you justice my good friend  . under that peculiar sort of dry blunt mannerknow you have the warmest heart  . astell mr  . . you arethorough humourist  .-- yes believe me knightleyam fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme  . you have hit upon the very thing to please me  . mr  . knightley had another reason for avoidingtable in the shade  . he wished to persuade mr  . woodhouse as well as emma to join the party and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill  . mr  . woodhouse must not under the specious pretence ofmorning drive and an hour or two spent at donwell be tempted away to his misery  . he was invited on good faith  . no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity  . he did consent  . he had not been at donwell for two years  . some very fine morning he and emma and harriet could go very well and he could sit still with mrs  . weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens  . he did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of the day  . he should like to see the old house again exceedingly and should be very happy to meet mr  . and mrs  . elton and any other of his neighbours  .-- he could not see any objection at all to his and emmaand harrietgoing there some very fine morning  . he thought it very well done of mr  . knightley to invite them -- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out  .-- he was not fond of dining out  . mr  . knightley was fortunate in every bodymost ready concurrence  . the invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like mrs  . elton they were all taking the scheme asparticular compliment to themselves  .-- emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it and mr  . weston unasked promised to get frank over to join them if possibleproof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with  .-- mr  . knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him and mr  . weston engaged to lose no time in writing and spare no arguments to induce him to come  . in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell was settled for one day and box hill for the next -- the weather appearing exactly right  . underbright mid - day sun at almost midsummer mr  . woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of this al - fresco party and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him byfire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise every body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves  .-- mrs  . weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired and sit all the time with him remained when all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser  . it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her fathercomfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding ofhouse and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family  . she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed bystream of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcelysight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up  .-- the house was larger than hartfield and totally unlike it coveringgood deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable and one or two handsome rooms  .-- it was just what it ought to be and it looked what it was -- and emma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence offamily of such true gentility untainted in blood and understanding  .-- some faults of temper john knightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably  . she had given them neither men nor names nor places that could raiseblush  . these were pleasant feelings and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the strawberry - beds  .-- the whole party were assembled excepting frank churchill who was expected every moment from richmond and mrs  . elton in all her apparatus of happiness her large bonnet and her basket was very ready to lead the way in gathering accepting or talking -- strawberries and only strawberries could now be thought or spoken of  .-- the best fruit in england -- every bodyfavourite -- always wholesome  .-- these the finest beds and finest sorts  .-- delightful to gather for oneself -- the only way of really enjoying them  .-- morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in london -- abundance about bristol -- maple grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade  . such for half an hour was the conversation -- interrupted only once by mrs  . weston who came out in her solicitude after her son - in - law to inquire if he were come -- and she waslittle uneasy  .-- she had some fears of his horse  . seats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs  . elton and jane fairfax were talking of  .--situationmost desirable situation was in question  . mrs  . elton had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures  . it was not with mrs  . suckling it was not with mrs  . bragge but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was withcousin of mrs  . bragge an acquaintance of mrs  . sucklinglady known at maple grove  . delightful charming superior first circles spheres lines ranks every thing -- and mrs  . elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately  .-- on her side all was warmth energy and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friendnegative though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before  .-- still mrs  . elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrowpost  .-- how jane could bear it at all was astonishing to emma  .-- she did look vexed she did speak pointedly -- and at last withdecision of action unusual to her proposedremoval  .-- should not they walk would not mr  . knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens -- she wished to see the whole extent  . -- the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear  . it was hot and after walking some time over the gardens inscattered dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade ofbroad short avenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds  .-- it led to nothing nothing butview at the end overlow stone wall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had been there  . disputable however as might be the taste of suchtermination it was in itselfcharming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty  .-- the considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquiredsteeper form beyond its grounds and at halfmile distant wasbank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood -- and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river makingclose and handsome curve around it  . it wassweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind  . english verdure english culture english comfort seen undersun bright without being oppressive  . in this walk emma and mr  . weston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived mr  . knightley and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way  . mr  . knightley and harriet -- it was an odd tete -- tete but she was glad to see it  .-- there had beentime when he would have scorned her ascompanion and turned from her with little ceremony  . now they seemed in pleasant conversation  . there had beentime also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet inspot so favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not  . it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom and light column of smoke ascending  .-- she joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around  . he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc  . and emma receivedsmile which seemed to say these are my own concerns  .haveright to talk on such subjects without being suspected of introducing robert martin  . -- she did not suspect him  . it was too oldstory  .-- robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet  .-- they tookfew turns together along the walk  .-- the shade was most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day  . the next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat -- and they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come  . mrs  . weston looked and looked in vain  . his father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare  . he had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty  . his aunt was so much better that he had notdoubt of getting over to them  . -- mrs  . churchillstate however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and mrs  . weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of mrs  . churchill that he was prevented coming  .-- emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion  . the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fish - ponds perhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot and growing cool again  .-- mr  . woodhouse who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no damps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more and his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs  . weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need  . mr  . knightley had done all in his power for mr  . woodhouseentertainment  . books of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning and the kindness had perfectly answered  . mr  . woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused  . mrs  . weston had been shewing them all to him and now he would shew them all to emma -- fortunate in having no other resemblance tochild than intotal want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodical  .-- before this second looking over was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake offew moments free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared coming quickly in from the garden and withlook of escape  .-- little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there wasstart at first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of  . will you be so kind said she whenam missed as to say thatam gone home --am going this moment  .-- my aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absent -- butam sure we shall be wanted andam determined to go directly  .--have said nothing about it to any body  . it would only be giving trouble and distress  . some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk  . till they all come inshall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say thatam gone certainly if you wish it -- but you are not going to walk to highbury alone yes -- what should hurt me --walk fast  .shall be at home in twenty minutes  . but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone  . let my fatherservant go with you  .-- let me order the carriage  . it can be round in five minutes  . thank you thank you -- but on no account  .--would rather walk  .-- and for me to be afraid of walking alone --who may so soon have to guard others she spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now  .must order the carriage  . the heat even would be danger  .-- you are fatigued already  .am -- she answered --am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me  .-- miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits  . mineconfess are exhausted  . the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say thatam gone when it is necessary  . emma had not another word to oppose  . she saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal offriend  . her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone -- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who loved her best  . suchhome indeed such an aunt said emma as she turned back into the hall again  .do pity you  . and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the moreshall like you  . jane had not been gonequarter of an hour and they had only accomplished some views of st  . markplace venice when frank churchill entered the room  . emma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him  . mrs  . weston would be at ease  . the black mare was blameless they were right who had named mrs  . churchill as the cause  . he had been detained bytemporary increase of illness in hernervous seizure which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming till very late -- and had he known how hotride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be he believed he should not have come at all  . the heat was excessive he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold etc  . but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr  . woodhousefire looking very deplorable  . you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma  . as soon asam coolershall go back again  .could very ill be spared -- but suchpoint had been made of my coming you will all be going soonsuppose the whole party breaking up  .met one ascame -- madness in such weather -- absolute madness emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchillstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour  . some people were always cross when they were hot  . such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door  . no -- he should not eat  . he was not hungry it would only make him hotter  . in two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about spruce - beer walked off  . emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret --am gladhave done being in love with him  .should not likeman who is so soon discomposed byhot morning  . harrietsweet easy temper will not mind it  . he was gone long enough to have hadvery comfortable meal and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and with good manners like himself -- able to drawchair close to them take an interest in their employment and regret inreasonable way that he should be so late  . he was not in his best spirits but seemed trying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense very agreeably  . they were looking over views in swisserland  . as soon as my aunt gets wellshall go abroad said he  .shall never be easy tillhave seen some of these places  . you will have my sketches some time or other to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem  .shall do something to expose myself  . that may be -- but not by sketches in swisserland  . you will never go to swisserland  . your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england  . they may be induced to go too  .warm climate may be prescribed for her  .have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad  .assure youhave  .feelstrong persuasion this morning thatshall soon be abroad  .ought to travel  .am tired of doing nothing  .wantchange  .am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy --am sick of england -- and would leave it to - morrow ifcould  . you are sick of prosperity and indulgence  . cannot you inventfew hardships for yourself and be contented to staysick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken  .do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged  .am thwarted in every thing material  .do not consider myself at allfortunate person  . you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came  . go and eat and drinklittle more and you will do very well  . another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly onpar with the rest of us  . no --shall not stir  .shall sit by you  . you are my best cure  . we are going to box hill to - morrow -- you will join us  . it is not swisserland but it will be something foryoung man so much in want ofchange  . you will stay and go with us no certainly notshall go home in the cool of the evening  . but you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning  . no -- it will not be worth while  . ifcomeshall be cross  . then pray stay at richmond  . but ifdoshall be crosser still  .can never bear to think of you all there without me  . these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself  . chuse your own degree of crossness  .shall press you no more  . the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected  . with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill others took it very composedly but there wasvery general distress and disturbance on miss fairfaxdisappearance being explained  . that it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and withshort final arrangement for the next dayscheme they parted  . frank churchilllittle inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to emma were well -- if you wish me to stay and join the partywill  . she smiled her acceptance and nothing less thansummons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening  . chapter vii they hadvery fine day for box hill and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in favour ofpleasant party  . mr  . weston directed the whole officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every body was in good time  . emma and harriet went together miss bates and her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback  . mrs  . weston remained with mr  . woodhouse  . nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there  . seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body hadburst of admiration on first arriving but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency  . there waslanguorwant of spiritswant of union which could not be got over  . they separated too much into parties  . the eltons walked together mr  . knightley took charge of miss bates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill  . and mr  . weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better  . it seemed at first an accidental division but it never materially varied  . mr  . and mrs  . elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill there seemedprinciple of separation between the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any cheerful mr  . weston to remove  . at first it was downright dulness to emma  . she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid  . he said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said  . while he was so dull it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable  . when they all sat down it was better to her tastegreat deal better for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object  . every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her  . to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared for -- and emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe  . mr  . frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively  . they were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off inletter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another  . not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected  . she laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart  . she still intended him for her friend  . how mucham obliged to you said he for telling me to come to - day -- if it had not been for youshould certainly have lost all the happiness of this party  .had quite determined to go away again  . yes you were very cross anddo not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries  .waskinder friend than you deserved  . but you were humble  . you begged hard to be commanded to come  . donsaywas cross  .was fatigued  . the heat overcame me  . it is hotter to - day  . not to my feelings  .am perfectly comfortable to - day  . you are comfortable because you are under command  . your command -- yes  . perhapsintended you to say so butmeant self - command  . you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to - day you are got back again -- and ascannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine  . it comes to the same thing  .can have no self - command withoutmotive  . you order me whether you speak or not  . and you can be always with me  . you are always with me  . dating from threeclock yesterday  . my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before  . threeclock yesterday that is your date  .thoughthad seen you first in february  . your gallantry is really unanswerable  . but lowering her voice -- nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people  .say nothing of whicham ashamed replied he with lively impudence  .saw you first in february  . let every body on the hill hear me if they can  . let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other  .saw you first in february  . and then whispering -- our companions are excessively stupid  . what shall we do to rouse them any nonsense will serve  . they shall talk  . ladies and gentlemenam ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of some laughed and answered good - humouredly  . miss bates saidgreat deal mrs  . elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhousepresiding mr  . knightleyanswer was the most distinct  . is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of oh no no -- cried emma laughing as carelessly as she could -- upon no account in the world  . it is the very last thingwould stand the brunt of just now  . let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of  .will not say quite all  . there are one or two perhaps glancing at mr  . weston and harriet whose thoughtsmight not be afraid of knowing  . it issort of thing cried mrs  . elton emphatically whichshould not have thought myself privileged to inquire into  . though perhaps as the chaperon of the party --never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women -- her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply very true my love very true  . exactly so indeed -- quite unheard of -- but some ladies say any thing  . better pass it off asjoke  . every body knows what is due to you  . it will not do whispered frank to emma they are most of them affronted  .will attack them with more address  . ladies and gentlemen --am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you ingeneral way  . here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever -- or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all  . oh very well exclaimed miss bates thenneed not be uneasy  . three things very dull indeed  . that will just do for me you know  .shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as everopen my mouth shani looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every bodyassent -- do not you all thinkshall emma could not resist  . ah ma am but there may bedifficulty  . pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once  . miss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not immediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could not anger thoughslight blush shewed that it could pain her  . ah -- well -- to be sure  . yessee what she means turning to mr  . knightley andwill try to hold my tongue  .must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said suchthing to an old friend  .like your plan cried mr  . weston  . agreed agreed  .will do my best  .am makingconundrum  . how willconundrum reckon lowam afraid sir very low answered his son -- but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way  . no no said emma it will not reckon low  .conundrum of mr  . westonshall clear him and his next neighbour  . come sir pray let me hear it  .doubt its being very clever myself said mr  . weston  . it is too muchmatter of fact but here it is  .-- what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection what two letters -- express perfectionam suredo not know  . ah you will never guess  . you to emmaam certain will never guess  .--will tell you  .-- . and .-- em - ma  .-- do you understand understanding and gratification came together  . it might bevery indifferent piece of wit but emma foundgreat deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did frank and harriet  .-- it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid about it and mr  . knightley gravely said this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr  . weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else  . perfection should not have come quite so soon  . oh for myselfprotestmust be excused said mrs  . eltonreally cannot attempt --am not at all fond of the sort of thing  .had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name whichwas not at all pleased with  .knew who it came from  . an abominable puppy -- you know whomean nodding to her husband  . these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer  . miss woodhouse must excuse me  .am not one of those who have witty things at every bodyservice  .do not pretend to bewit  .havegreat deal of vivacity in my own way butreally must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue  . pass us if you please mr  . churchill  . pass mr  . . knightley jane and myself  . we have nothing clever to say -- not one of us  . yes yes pray pass me added her husband withsort of sneering consciousnesshave nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady  . an old married man -- quite good for nothing  . shall we walk augusta with all my heart  .am really tired of exploring so long on one spot  . come jane take my other arm  . jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off  . happy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out of hearing -- how well they suit one another -- very lucky -- marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only inpublic place -- they only knew each otherthinkfew weeks in bath peculiarly lucky -- for as to any real knowledge ofpersondisposition that bath or any public place can give -- it is all nothing there can be no knowledge  . it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment  . short of that it is all guess and luck -- and will generally be ill - luck  . how manyman has committed himself onshort acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now  . such things do occur undoubtedly  . -- she was stopped bycough  . frank churchill turned towards her to listen  . you were speaking said he gravely  . she recovered her voice  .was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and womencannot imagine them to be very frequent  .hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards  .would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever  . he made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon afterwards said inlively tone wellhave so little confidence in my own judgment that whenevermarryhope some body will chuse my wife for me  . will you turning to emma  . will you chusewife for me --am sureshould like any body fixed on by you  . you provide for the family you know withsmile at his father  . find some body for me  .am in no hurry  . adopt her educate her  . and make her like myself  . by all means if you can  . very well  .undertake the commission  . you shall havecharming wife  . she must be very lively and have hazle eyes  .care for nothing else  .shall go abroad forcouple of years -- and whenreturnshall come to you for my wife  . remember  . emma was in no danger of forgetting  . it wascommission to touch every favourite feeling  . would not harriet be the very creature described hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished  . he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment who could say referring the education to her seemed to imply it  . now ma am said jane to her aunt shall we join mrs  . elton if you please my dear  . with all my heart  .am quite ready  .was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well  . we shall soon overtake her  . there she is -- no thatsomebody else  . thatone of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her  .-- welldeclare -- they walked off followed in halfminute by mr  . knightley  . mr  . weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young manspirits now rose topitch almost unpleasant  . even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her  . the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages wasjoyful sight and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of mrs  . elton to have her carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure  . such another scheme composed of so many ill - assorted people she hoped never to be betrayed into again  . while waiting for the carriage she found mr  . knightley by her side  . he looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said emmamust once more speak to you ashave been used to doprivilege rather endured than allowed perhaps butmust still use it  .cannot see you acting wrong withoutremonstrance  . how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit towoman of her character age and situation -- emmahad not thought it possible  . emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off  . nay how couldhelp saying whatdid -- nobody could have helped it  . it was not so very bad  .dare say she did not understand me  .assure you she did  . she felt your full meaning  . she has talked of it since  .wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity  .wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome  . oh cried emmaknow there is notbetter creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her  . they are blended said heacknowledge and were she prosperouscould allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good  . were shewoman of fortunewould leave every harmless absurdity to take its chancewould not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner  . were she your equal in situation -- but emma consider how far this is from being the case  . she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more  . her situation should secure your compassion  . it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up fromperiod when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her -- and before her niece too -- and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her  .-- this is not pleasant to you emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me butmustwill --will tell you truths whilecan satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now  . while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in  . he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless  . they were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern  . she had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back formoment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shewdifference but it was just too late  . he had turned away and the horses were in motion  . she continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind  . she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal  . never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life  . she was most forcibly struck  . the truth of this representation there was no denying  . she felt it at her heart  . how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness time did not compose her  . as she reflected more she seemed but to feel it more  . she never had been so depressed  . happily it was not necessary to speak  . there was only harriet who seemed not in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were  . chapter viii the wretchedness ofscheme to box hill was in emmathoughts all the evening  . how it might be considered by the rest of the party she could not tell  . they in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it wasmorning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than any she had ever passed  .whole evening of back - gammon with her father was felicity to it  . there indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach  . asdaughter she hoped she was not withoutheart  . she hoped no one could have said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your father --mustwill tell you truths whilecan  . miss bates should never again -- no never if attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven  . she had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious  . but it should be so no more  . in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side ofregular equal kindly intercourse  . she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her  . it was not unlikely she thought that she might see mr  . knightley in her way or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit  . she had no objection  . she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers  . her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not  . the ladies were all at home  . she had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule  . there wasbustle on her approachgood deal of moving and talking  . she heard miss batesvoice something was to be done inhurry the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased to waitmoment and then ushered her in too soon  . the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room  . jane she haddistinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door had shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dearshall say you are laid down upon the bed andam sure you are ill enough  . poor old mrs  . bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on  .am afraid jane is not very well said she butdo not know they tell me she is well  .dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse  .hope you findchair  .wish hetty had not gone  .am very little able -- have youchair ma am do you sit where you likeam sure she will be here presently  . emma seriously hoped she would  . she hadmomentfear of miss bates keeping away from her  . but miss bates soon came -- very happy and obliged -- but emmaconscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner  .very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead the way toreturn of old feelings  . the touch seemed immediate  . ah miss woodhouse how kind you are --suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy  . this does not seem much like joy indeed in me -- twinkling awaytear or two -- but it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long and she hasdreadful headache just now writing all the morning -- such long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell and mrs  . dixon  . my dear saidyou will blind yourself -- for tears were in her eyes perpetually  . one cannot wonder one cannot wonder  . it isgreat change and though she is amazingly fortunate -- suchsituationsuppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortune -- again dispersing her tears -- but poor dear soul if you were to see whatheadache she has  . when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve  . she is as low as possible  . to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured suchsituation  . you will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room --want her to lie down upon the bed  . my dear saidi shall say you are laid down upon the bed but however she is not she is walking about the room  . but now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well  . she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will excuse her  . you were kept waiting at the door --was quite ashamed -- but somehow there waslittle bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not know any body was coming  . it is only mrs  . cole saiddepend upon it  . nobody else would come so early  . well said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now  . but then patty came in and said it was you  . oh saidit is miss woodhouseam sure you will like to see her  . --can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were  . if you must go my dear saidyou must andwill say you are laid down upon the bed  . emma was most sincerely interested  . her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted ascure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs  . cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself  . she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on might be as much for miss fairfaxadvantage and comfort as possible  . it must besevere trial to them all  . she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbellreturn  . so very kind replied miss bates  . but you are always kind  . there was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of -- where -- mayask -- is miss fairfax going tomrs  . smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children  . impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs  . sucklingown family and mrs  . braggebut mrs  . smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood -- lives only four miles from maple grove  . jane will be only four miles from maple grove  . mrs  . eltonsuppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes -- yes our good mrs  . elton  . the most indefatigable true friend  . she would not takedenial  . she would not let jane say no for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbellreturn and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told mrs  . elton over and over again -- andam surehad no more idea that she would change her mind -- but that good mrs  . elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther thandid  . it is not every body that would have stood out in suchkind way as she did and refuse to take janeanswer but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would wait -- and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go  . quitesurprize to mehad not the least idea -- jane took mrs  . elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs  . smallridgesituation she had come to the resolution of accepting it  .--did not knowword of it till it was all settled  . you spent the evening with mrs  . elton yes all of us mrs  . elton would have us come  . it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr  . knightley  . you must all spend your evening with us said she --positively must have you all come  . mr  . knightley was there too was he no not mr  . knightley he declined it from the first and thoughthought he would come because mrs  . elton declared she would not let him off he did not -- but my mother and jane andwere all there andvery agreeable evening we had  . such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morningparty  . even pleasure you know is fatiguing -- andcannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it  . howevershall always think itvery pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it  . miss fairfaxsuppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole daydare say she had  . whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- buthope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible --mean as to the character and manners of the family  . thank you dear miss woodhouse  . yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it  . except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs  . eltonacquaintance  . mrs  . smallridgemost delightful woman --style of living almost equal to maple grove -- and as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere  . jane will be treated with such regard and kindness -- it will be nothing but pleasurelife of pleasure  .-- and her salary --really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse  . even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given toyoung person like jane  . ah madam cried emma if other children are at all like whatremember to have been myselfshould think five times the amount of whathave ever yet heard named assalary on such occasions dearly earned  . you are so noble in your ideas and when is miss fairfax to leave you very soon very soon indeed thatthe worst of it  . withinfortnight  . mrs  . smallridge is ingreat hurry  . my poor mother does not know how to bear it  . so thentry to put it out of her thoughts and say come ma am do not let us think about it any more  . her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs  . campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is suchsituation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining  .was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs  . elton and when mrs  . elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea -- stay -- no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea becauseremember thinking -- oh no nowrecollect nowhave it something happened before tea but not that  . mr  . elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdyson wanted to speak with him  . poor old johnhavegreat regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years and now poor old man he is bed - ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints --must go and see him to - day and so will janeam sure if she gets out at all  . and poor johnson came to talk to mr  . elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr  . elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr  . frank churchill to richmond  . that was what happened before tea  . it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs  . elton  . miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr  . frank churchillgoing she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence  . what mr  . elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the accumulation of the ostlerown knowledge and the knowledge of the servants at randalls was thatmessenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill -- which messenger however had been no more than was expected and that mr  . churchill had sent his nephewfew lines containing upon the wholetolerable account of mrs  . churchill and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early but that mr  . frank churchill having resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse seeming to have gotcold tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy goinggood pace and driving very steady  . there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it caught emmaattention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind  . the contrast between mrs  . churchillimportance in the world and jane fairfaxstruck her one was every thing the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of womandestiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss batessaying ayesee what you are thinking of the pianoforte  . what is to become of that -- very true  . poor dear jane was talking of it just now  .-- you must go said she  . you andmust part  . you will have no business here  .-- let it stay however said she give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back  .shall talk about it to him he will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties  . -- and to this daydo believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter . now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough and withrepetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave  . chapter ix emmapensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her  . mr  . knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her father  .-- mr  . knightley immediately got up and inmanner decidedly graver than usual saidwould not go away without seeing you buthave no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly  .am going to london to spendfew days with john and isabella  . have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries nothing at all  . but is not thissudden scheme yes -- rather --have been thinking of it some little time  . emma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself  . time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again  . while he stood as if meaning to go but not going -- her father began his inquiries  . well my dear and did you get there safely -- and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter --dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming  . dear emma has been to call on mrs  . and miss bates mr  . knightley astold you before  . she is always so attentive to them emmacolour was heightened by this unjust praise and withsmile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr  . knightley  .-- it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour as if his eyes received the truth from herand all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured  .-- he looked at her withglow of regard  . she was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so bylittle movement of more than common friendliness on his part  .-- he took her hand -- whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say -- she might perhaps have rather offered it -- but he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go  .-- why he should feel suchscruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not perceive  .-- he would have judged better she thought if he had not stopped  .-- the intention however was indubitable and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more  .-- it was with him of so simple yet so dignifiednature  .-- she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction  . it spoke such perfect amity  .-- he left them immediately afterwards -- gone inmoment  . he always moved with the alertness ofmind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance  . emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier -- it would have beengreat pleasure to talk over jane fairfaxsituation with mr  . knightley  .-- neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened atbetter time -- and to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanter  .-- they parted thorough friends however she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unfinished gallantry -- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion  .-- he had been sitting with them half an hour she found  . it waspity that she had not come back earlier in the hope of diverting her fatherthoughts from the disagreeableness of mr  . knightleygoing to london and going so suddenly and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad emma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence on the effect was justified it suppliedvery useful check -- interested without disturbing him  . he had long made up his mind to jane fairfaxgoing out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully but mr  . knightleygoing to london had been an unexpected blow  .am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled  . mrs  . elton is very good - natured and agreeable anddare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be  .hope it isdry situation and that her health will be taken good care of  . it ought to befirst object asam sure poor miss tayloralways was with me  . you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us  . andhope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long  . the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background  . an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs  . churchill though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return  .sudden seizure ofdifferent nature from any thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off aftershort struggle  . the great mrs  . churchill was no more  . it was felt as such things must be felt  . every body haddegree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and inreasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried  . goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally to be recommended asclearer of ill - fame  . mrs  . churchill after being disliked at least twenty - five years was now spoken of with compassionate allowances  . in one point she was fully justified  . she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill  . the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints  . poor mrs  . churchill no doubt she had been sufferinggreat deal more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper  . it wassad event --great shock -- with all her faults what would mr  . churchill do without her mr  . churchillloss would be dreadful indeed  . mr  . churchill would never get over it  . -- even mr  . weston shook his head and looked solemn and said ah poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his mourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems withcommiseration and good sense true and steady  . how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both  . it was alsovery early speculation with emma  . the character of mrs  . churchill the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event how benefited how freed  . she saw inmoment all the possible good  . now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter  . mr  . churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew  . all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed  . harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great self - command  . what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing  . emma was gratified to observe suchproof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance  . they spoke therefore of mrs  . churchilldeath with mutual forbearance  . short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans  . mr  . churchill was better than could be expected and their first removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house ofvery old friend in windsor to whom mr  . churchill had been promisingvisit the last ten years  . at present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emmaside  . it wasmore pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose prospects were closing while harrietopened and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished to shew her kindness -- and with emma it was grown intofirst wish  . she had scarcelystronger regret than for her past coldness and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy  . she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shewvalue for her society and testify respect and consideration  . she resolved to prevail on her to spendday at hartfield  .note was written to urge it  . the invitation was refused and byverbal message  . miss fairfax was not well enough to write and when mr  . perry called at hartfield the same morning it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe headaches andnervous fever todegree which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs  . smallridgeat the time proposed  . her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension of the family mr  . perry was uneasy about her  . he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would not own it  . her spirits seemed overcome  . her present home he could not but observe was unfavourable tonervous disorder -- confined always to one room -- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description  . her care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact only too great  . he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them  . emma listened with the warmest concern grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful  . to take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two might do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name -- mentioning that she had mr  . perrydecided opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient  . the answer was only in this short note miss fairfaxcompliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise  . emma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted  . in spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to mrs  . batesin the hope that jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do -- miss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain  . miss bates was obliged to return without success jane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse  .-- emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in  . indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- mrs  . elton indeed could not be denied -- and mrs  . cole had made suchpoint -- and mrs  . perry had said so much -- but except them jane would really see nobody  . emma did not want to be classed with the mrs  . eltons the mrs  . perrys and the mrs  . coles who would force themselves anywhere neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther as to her nieceappetite and diet which she longed to be able to assist  . on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy and very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing -- mr  . perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful  . emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an examination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates withmost friendly note  . in half an hour the arrowroot was returned withthousand thanks from miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back it wasthing she could not take -- and moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing  . when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together -- that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her  . she was sorry very sorry  . her heart was grieved forstate which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy asfriend but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself that could mr  . knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove  . chapterone morning about ten days after mrs  . churchilldecease emma was called downstairs to mr  . weston who could not stay five minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her  . -- he met her at the parlour - door and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father can you come to randalls at any time this morning -- do if it be possible  . mrs  . weston wants to see you  . she must see you  . is she unwell no no not at all -- onlylittle agitated  . she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you know -- nodding towards her father -- humph -- can you come certainly  . this moment if you please  . it is impossible to refuse what you ask in suchway  . but what can be the matter -- is she really not ill depend upon me -- but ask no more questions  . you will know it all in time  . the most unaccountable business but hush hush to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma  . something really important seemed announced by his looks but as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now she and mr  . weston were soon out of the house together and on their way atquick pace for randalls  . now -- said emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates -- now mr  . weston do let me know what has happened  . no no -- he gravely replied  .-- donask me  .promised my wife to leave it all to her  . she will break it to you better thancan  . do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon  . break it to me cried emma standing still with terror  .-- good god -- mr  . weston tell me at once  .-- something has happened in brunswick square  .know it has  . tell mecharge you tell me this moment what it is  . no indeed you are mistaken  . -- mr  . weston do not trifle with me  .-- consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square  . which of them is it --charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment  . upon my word emma  . -- your word -- why not your honour -- why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavens -- what can be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family upon my honour said he very seriously it does not  . it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley  . emmacourage returned and she walked on  .was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you  .should not have used the expression  . in fact it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself -- that is we hope  .-- humph -- in short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it  .donsay that it is notdisagreeable business -- but things might be much worse  .-- if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls  . emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort  . she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light ofdisagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family -- something which the late event at richmond had brought forward  . her fancy was very active  . halfdozen natural children perhaps -- and poor frank cut off -- this though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her  . it inspired little more than an animating curiosity  . who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist mr  . weston in keeping his secret than with any other view  .do not know  .-- one of the otways  .-- not frank -- it is not frankassure you  . you will not see him  . he is half way to windsor by this time  . has your son been with you then oh yes -- did not you know -- well well never mind  . formoment he was silent and then added intone much more guarded and demure yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did  . they hurried on and were speedily at randalls  .-- well my dear said he as they entered the room --have brought her and nowhope you will soon be better  .shall leave you together  . there is no use in delay  .shall not be far off if you want me  . -- and emma distinctly heard him add inlower tone before he quitted the room --have been as good as my word  . she has not the least idea  . mrs  . weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation that emmauneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly said what is it my dear friend something ofvery unpleasant naturefind has occurred -- do let me know directly what it is  .have been walking all this way in complete suspense  . we both abhor suspense  . do not let mine continue longer  . it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be  . have you indeed no idea said mrs  . weston intrembling voice  . cannot you my dear emma -- cannot you formguess as to what you are to hear so far as that it relates to mr  . frank churchilldo guess  . you are right  . it does relate to him andwill tell you directly resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up  . he has been here this very morning onmost extraordinary errand  . it is impossible to express our surprize  . he came to speak to his father onsubject -- to announce an attachment -- she stopped to breathe  . emma thought first of herself and then of harriet  . more than an attachment indeed resumed mrs  . weston an engagement --positive engagement  .-- what will you say emma -- what will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged -- nay that they have been long engaged emma even jumped with surprize -- and horror - struck exclaimed jane fairfax -- good god you are not serious you do not mean it you may well be amazed returned mrs  . weston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover -- you may well be amazed  . but it is even so  . there has beensolemn engagement between them ever since october -- formed at weymouth and keptsecret from every body  . notcreature knowing it but themselves -- neither the campbells nor her family nor his  .-- it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself  .can hardly believe it  .--thoughtknew him  . emma scarcely heard what was said  .-- her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax and poor harriet -- and for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation  . well said she at last trying to recover herself this iscircumstance whichmust think of at least halfday beforecan at all comprehend it  . what -- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to highbury engaged since october -- secretly engaged  .-- it has hurt me emma very much  . it has hurt his father equally  . some part of his conduct we cannot excuse  . emma ponderedmoment and then repliedwill not pretend not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of  . mrs  . weston looked up afraid to believe but emmacountenance was as steady as her words  . that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference she continuedwill farther tell you that there wasperiod in the early part of our acquaintance whendid like him whenwas very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay was attached -- and how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder  . fortunately however it did cease  .have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him  . you may believe me mrs  . weston  . this is the simple truth  . mrs  . weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could find utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do  . mr  . weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she  . on this point we have been wretched  . it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so  .-- imagine what we have been feeling on your account  .have escaped and thatshould escape may bematter of grateful wonder to you and myself  . but this does not acquit him mrs  . weston andmust say thatthink him greatly to blame  . what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another -- how could he tell what mischief he might be doing -- how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him -- very wrong very wrong indeed  . from something that he said my dear emmarather imagine -- and how could she bear such behaviour composure withwitness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it  .-- that isdegree of placidity whichcan neither comprehend nor respect  . there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly  . he had not time to enter into much explanation  . he was here onlyquarter of an hour and instate of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said  . the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct  . impropriety oh mrs  . weston -- it is too calmcensure  . much much beyond impropriety -- it has sunk himcannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion  . so unlike whatman should be -- none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness whichman should display in every transaction of his life  . nay dear emma nowmust take his part for though he has been wrong in this instancehave known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and -- good god cried emma not attending to her  .-- mrs  . smallridge too jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself -- to suffer her even to think of suchmeasure he knew nothing about it emma  . on this articlecan fully acquit him  . it wasprivate resolution of hers not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated inway to carry conviction  .-- till yesterdayknow he said he was in the dark as to her plans  . they burst on himdo not know how but by some letter or message -- and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long  . emma began to listen better  .am to hear from him soon continued mrs  . weston  . he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke inmanner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now  . let us wait therefore for this letter  . it may bring many extenuations  . it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood  . donlet us be severe donlet us be inhurry to condemn him  . let us have patience  .must love him and now thatam satisfied on one point the one material pointam sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may  . they must both have sufferedgreat deal under suchsystem of secresy and concealment  . his sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done him much harm  . well and how did mr  . churchill take it most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcelydifficulty  . conceive what the events ofweek have done in that family while poor mrs  . churchill livedsuppose there could not have beenhopechancepossibility -- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required  . whatblessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave -- he gave his consent with very little persuasion  . ah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet  . this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this morning  . he stopped at highbury at the batesi fancy some time -- and then came on hither but was in suchhurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that astell you he could stay with us butquarter of an hour  .-- he was very much agitated -- very much indeed -- todegree that made him appear quitedifferent creature from any thinghad ever seen him before  .-- in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of -- and there was every appearance of his having been feelinggreat deal  . and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy -- the campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement emma could not speak the name of dixon withoutlittle blush  . none not one  . he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves  . well said emmasuppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea andwish them very happy  . butshall always think itvery abominable sort of proceeding  . what has it been butsystem of hypocrisy and deceit -- espionage and treachery -- to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and suchleague in secret to judge us all -- here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear  .-- they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of inway not perfectly agreeableam quite easy on that head replied mrs  . weston  .am very sure thatnever said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard  . you are in luck  .-- your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imaginedcertain friend of ours in love with the lady  . true  . but ashave always hadthoroughly good opinion of miss fairfaxnever could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him theremust have been safe  . at this moment mr  . weston appeared atlittle distance from the window evidently on the watch  . his wife gave himlook which invited him in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match  . let us make the best of it -- and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour  . it is notconnexion to gratify but if mr  . churchill does not feel that why should we and it may bevery fortunate circumstance for him for frankmean that he should have attached himself togirl of such steadiness of character and good judgment ashave always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right  . and how much may be said in her situation for even that error much indeed cried emma feelingly  . ifwoman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is insituation like jane fairfax .-- of such one may almost say that the world is not theirnor the worldlaw  . she met mr  . weston on his entrance withsmiling countenance exclaimingvery pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this wasdevicesuppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing  . but you really frightened me  .thought you had lost half your property at least  . and here instead of its beingmatter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation  .--congratulate you mr  . weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter  .glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate  . his air and voice recovered their usual briskness he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject inmanner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing  . his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence or smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again with emma in their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done  . chapter xi harriet poor harriet -- those were the words in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her  . frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways -- but it was not so much his behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him  . it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harrietaccount that gave the deepest hue to his offence  .-- poor harriet to besecond time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery  . mr  . knightley had spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been no friend to harriet smith  . -- she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice  .-- it was true that she had not to charge herself in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harrietimagination for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given herhint on the subject but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed  . she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments  . her influence would have been enough  . and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them  .-- she felt that she had been risking her friendhappiness on most insufficient grounds  . common sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her  .-- but with common sense she addedam afraidhave had little to do  . she was extremely angry with herself  . if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful  .-- as for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account  . harriet would be anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose ill - health having of course the same origin must be equally under cure  .-- her days of insignificance and evil were over  .-- she would soon be well and happy and prosperous  .-- emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted  . this discovery laid many smaller matters open  . no doubt it had been from jealousy  .-- in janeeyes she had beenrival and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed  . an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison  . she understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert  . but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else  . emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first  . considering the very superior claims of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harrietmind producing reserve and self - command it would  .-- she must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible  . an injunction of secresy had been among mr  . westonparting words  . for the present the whole affair was to be completelysecret  . mr  . churchill had madepoint of it astoken of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum  . -- emma had promised but still harriet must be excepted  . it was her superior duty  . in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet which mrs  . weston had just gone through by herself  . the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another  . her heart beat quick on hearing harrietfootstep and voice so she supposed had poor mrs  . weston felt when she was approaching randalls  . could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance -- but of that unfortunately there could be no chance  . well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the room -- is not this the oddest news that ever was what news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look or voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint  . about jane fairfax  . did you ever hear any thing so strange oh -- you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr  . weston has told me himself  .met him just now  . he told me it was to begreat secret and thereforeshould not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it  . what did mr  . weston tell you -- said emma still perplexed  . oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr  . frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while  . how very odd it was indeed so odd harrietbehaviour was so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand it  . her character appeared absolutely changed  . she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery  . emma looked at her quite unable to speak  . had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with her -- you perhaps might  .-- you blushing as she spoke who can see into every bodyheart but nobody else -- upon my word said emmabegin to doubt my having any such talent  . can you seriously ask me harriet whetherimagined him attached to another woman at the very time thatwas -- tacitly if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings --never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr  . frank churchillhaving the least regard for jane fairfax  . you may be very sure that ifhadshould have cautioned you accordingly  . me cried harriet colouring and astonished  . why should you caution me -- you do not thinkcare about mr  . frank churchill  .am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there wastime -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him him -- never never  . dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me turning away distressed  . harriet cried emma aftermomentpause -- what do you mean -- good heaven what do you mean -- mistake you -- amto suppose then -- she could not speak another word  .-- her voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer  . harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak it was invoice nearly as agitated as emma .should not have thought it possible she began that you could have misunderstood meknow we agreed never to name him -- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body elseshould not have thought it possible thatcould be supposed to mean any other person  . mr  . frank churchill indeeddo not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other  .hopehavebetter taste than to think of mr  . frank churchill who is like nobody by his side  . and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing --am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachmentshould have considered it at first too greatpresumption almost to dare to think of him  . at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words --should not have dared to give way to --should not have thought it possible -- but if you who had been always acquainted with him -- harriet cried emma collecting herself resolutely -- let us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake  . are you speaking of -- mr  . knightley to be suream  .never could have an idea of any body else -- and sothought you knew  . when we talked about him it was as clear as possible  . not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that you then said appeared to me to relate todifferent person  .could almost assert that you had named mr  . frank churchill  .am sure the service mr  . frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of  . oh miss woodhouse how you do forget my dear harrietperfectly remember the substance of whatsaid on the occasion  .told you thatdid not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural -- and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue  .-- the impression of it is strong on my memory  . oh dear cried harriet nowrecollect what you mean butwas thinking of something very different at the time  . it was not the gipsies -- it was not mr  . frank churchill thatmeant  . no with some elevationwas thinking ofmuch more precious circumstance -- of mr  . knightleycoming and asking me to dance when mr  . elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room  . that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth  . good god cried emma this has beenmost unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake -- what is to be done you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least howevercannot be worse off thanshould have been if the other had been the person and now -- it is possible -- she pausedfew moments  . emma could not speak  .do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feelgreat difference between the two as to me or as to any body  . you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other  . buthope miss woodhouse that supposing -- that if -- strange as it may appear -- . but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr  . frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if suchthing even as this may have occurred before -- and ifshould be so fortunate beyond expression as to -- if mr  . knightley should really -- if he does not mind the disparityhope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way  . but you are too good for thatam sure  . harriet was standing at one of the windows  . emma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said have you any idea of mr  . knightleyreturning your affection yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfully --must say thathave  . emmaeyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating infixed attitude forfew minutes  .few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart  .mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress  . she touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth  . why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr  . knightley than with frank churchill why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriethaving some hope ofreturn it darted through her with the speed of an arrow that mr  . knightley must marry no one but herself her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same few minutes  . she saw it all withclearness which had never blessed her before  . how improperly had she been acting by harriet how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct what blindness what madness had led her on it struck her with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world  . some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance andstrong sense of justice by harriet -- there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by mr  . knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness  .-- for her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost extent of harriethopes should be enquired into and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right  .-- rousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion she turned to harriet again and inmore inviting accent renewed the conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lost  .-- neither of them thought but of mr  . knightley and themselves  . harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of suchjudge and suchfriend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight  .-- emmatremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than harrietbut they were not less  . her voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that suchdevelopment of self suchburst of threatening evil suchconfusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create  .-- she listened with much inward suffering but with great outward patience to harrietdetail  .-- methodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narrationsubstance to sink her spirit -- especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of mr  . knightleymost improved opinion of harriet  . harriet had been conscious ofdifference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances  .-- emma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation  . from that evening or at least from the time of miss woodhouseencouraging her to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quitedifferent manner towards hermanner of kindness and sweetness -- latterly she had been more and more aware of it  . when they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very delightfully -- he seemed to want to be acquainted with her  . emma knew it to have been very much the case  . she had often observed the change to almost the same extent  .-- harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet  . he praised her for being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings  .-- she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt on them to her more than once  .-- much that lived in harrietmemory many little particulars of the notice she had received from himlookspeechremoval from one chair to anothercompliment impliedpreference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected by emma  . circumstances that might swell to half an hourrelation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without some degree of witness from emma herself  .-- the first was his walking with her apart from the others in the lime - walk at donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first he had talked to her inmore particular way than he had ever done before invery particular way indeed -- harriet could not recall it withoutblush  . he seemed to be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged  .-- but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about farming -- the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at hartfield -- though when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to her  . the superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her severe pain  . on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did afterlittle reflection venture the following question  . might he not -- is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr  . martin -- he might have mr  . martininterest in view but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit  . mr  . martin no indeed -- there was nothint of mr  . martin  .hopeknow better now than to care for mr  . martin or to be suspected of it  . when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope  .never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but for you  . you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and sohave  . but nowseem to feel thatmay deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful  . the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emmaside to enable her to say on reply harrietwill only venture to declare that mr  . knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does  . harriet seemed ready to worship her friend forsentence so satisfactory and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her fatherfootsteps  . he was coming through the hall  . harriet was too much agitated to encounter him  . she could not compose herself -- mr  . woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go -- with most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of emmafeelings oh god thathad never seen her the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughts  .-- she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours  . every moment had broughtfresh surprize and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her  .-- how to understand it all how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself and living under -- the blunders the blindness of her own head and heart -- she sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubbery -- in every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed on by others inmost mortifying degree that she had been imposing on herself indegree yet more mortifying that she was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness  . to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour  . to that point went every leisure moment which her fatherclaims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind  . how long had mr  . knightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be when had his influence such influence begun -- when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank churchill had once forshort period occupied -- she looked back she compared the two -- compared them as they had always stood in her estimation from the time of the latterbecoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it -- oh had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison  .-- she saw that there never had beentime when she did not consider mr  . knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear  . she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely underdelusion totally ignorant of her own heart -- and in short that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection  . this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching it  .-- she was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for mr  . knightley  .-- every other part of her mind was disgusting  . with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every bodyfeelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every bodydestiny  . she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief  . she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on mr  . knightley  .-- were this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given itbeginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only byconsciousness of harriet-- and even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly  . mr  . knightley and harriet smith -- it wasunion to distance every wonder of the kind  .-- the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing to be said or thought  .-- mr  . knightley and harriet smith -- such an elevation on her side suchdebasement on his it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand inconveniences to himself  .-- could it be -- no it was impossible  . and yet it was far very far from impossible  .-- was itnew circumstance forman of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers was it new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be the prize ofgirl who would seek him -- was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruous -- or for chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate oh had she never brought harriet forward had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she ought -- had she not withfolly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been  . how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr  . knightley -- how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of suchman till actually assured of it -- but harriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerly  .-- her inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little felt  .-- she had seemed more sensible of mr  . eltonbeing to stoop in marrying her than she now seemed of mr  . knightley .-- alas was not that her own doing too who had been at pains to give harriet notions of self - consequence but herself -- who but herself had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible and that her claims were great tohigh worldly establishment -- if harriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too  . chapter xii till now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with mr  . knightley first in interest and affection  .-- satisfied that it was so and feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection and only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had been  .-- long very long she felt she had been first for having no female connexions of his own there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella  . she had herself been first with him for many years past  . she had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her fromgirl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared  . in spite of all her faults she knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear -- when the suggestions of hope however which must follow here presented themselves she could not presume to indulge them  . harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by mr  . knightley  . she could not  . she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her  . she had receivedvery recent proof of its impartiality  .-- how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates how directly how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject -- not too strongly for the offence -- but far far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill  .-- she had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question but there washope at timesslight one at times much stronger that harriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his regard for her  .-- wish it she must for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life  . could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she believed she should be perfectly satisfied  .-- let him but continue the same mr  . knightley to her and her father the same mr  . knightley to all the world let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace would be fully secured  .-- marriage in fact would not do for her  . it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt for him  . nothing should separate her from her father  . she would not marry even if she were asked by mr  . knightley  . it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were  .-- she should see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here  .-- he was expected back every day  . the power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course  . in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harriet  .-- it would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farther  .-- she was resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing harrietconfidence  . to talk would be only to irritate  .-- she wrote to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not at present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided and hoping that iffew days were allowed to pass before they met again except in the company of others -- she objected only totete -- tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday  .-- harriet submitted and approved and was grateful  . this point was just arranged whenvisitor arrived to tear emmathoughtslittle from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twenty - four hours -- mrs  . weston who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect and took hartfield in her way home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview  . mr  . weston had accompanied her to mrs  . batesand gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction thanquarter of an hour spent in mrs  . batesparlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded  .little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related  . mrs  . weston had set off to pay the visit ingood deal of agitation herself and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call tilllittle time had passed and mr  . churchill could be reconciled to the engagementbecoming known as considering every thing she thought suchvisit could not be paid without leading to reports -- but mr  . weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were that it would be of any consequence for such things he observed always got about  . emma smiled and felt that mr  . weston had very good reason for saying so  . they had gone in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady  . she had hardly been able to speakword and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness  . the quiet heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual had beengratifying yet almost an affecting scene  . they were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them  . miss fairfaxrecent illness had offeredfair plea for mrs  . weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and declined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the course of their drive mrs  . weston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject  . apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr  . weston must necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by they had talkedgood deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement  . mrs  . weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject  . on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months continued mrs  . weston she was energetic  . this was one of her expressions  .will not say that sinceentered into the engagementhave not had some happy moments butcan say thathave never known the blessing of one tranquil hour -- and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation thatfelt at my heart  . poor girl said emma  . she thinks herself wrong then for having consented toprivate engagement wrong no onebelieve can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself  . the consequence said she has beenstate of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought  . but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct  . pain is no expiation  .never can be blameless  .have been acting contrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken and the kindnessam now receiving is what my conscience tells me ought not to be  . do not imagine madam she continued thatwas taught wrong  . do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up  . the error has been all my own anddo assure you that with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to giveshall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell  . poor girl said emma again  . she loves him then excessivelysuppose  . it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement  . her affection must have overpowered her judgment  . yeshave no doubt of her being extremely attached to him  .am afraid returned emma sighing thatmust often have contributed to make her unhappy  . on your side my love it was very innocently done  . but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before  . one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her unreasonable  . the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her tothousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable todegree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear  .did not make the allowances said she whichought to have done for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances wouldam sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first  . she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and withblush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me wheneverhad an opportunity to thank you --could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good  . she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself  . ifdid not know her to be happy now said emma seriously which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must becould not bear these thanks -- for oh mrs  . weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the goodhave done miss fairfax -- well checking herself and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten  . you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars  . they shew her to the greatest advantage  .am sure she is very good --hope she will be very happy  . it is fit that the fortune should be on his side forthink the merit will be all on hers  . suchconclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs  . weston  . she thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest  . she talked withgreat deal of reason and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for emmaattention it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when mrs  . weston ended with we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know buthope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for  . are you well my emma was mrs  . westonparting question  . oh perfectly  .am always well you know  . be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible  . mrs  . westoncommunications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax  . she bitterly regretted not having soughtcloser acquaintance with her and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause  . had she followed mr  . knightleyknown wishes in paying that attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy had she endeavoured to findfriend there instead of in harriet smith she must in all probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now  .-- birth abilities and education had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received with gratitude and the other -- what was she -- supposing even that they had never become intimate friends that she had never been admitted into miss fairfaxconfidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still in knowing her as she ought and as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr  . dixon which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been madesubject of material distress to the delicacy of janefeelings by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill . of all the sources of evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst  . she must have beenperpetual enemy  . they never could have been all three together without her having stabbed jane fairfaxpeace inthousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been the agony ofmind that would bear no more  . the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield  . the weather added what it could of gloom  .cold stormy rain set in and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible  . the weather affected mr  . woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughterside and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before  . it reminded her of their first forlorn tete -- tete on the evening of mrs  . westonwedding - day but mr  . knightley had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy  . alas such delightful proofs of hartfieldattraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly be over  . the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost  .-- but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction  . the prospect before her now was threatening todegree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened  . if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must be comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness  . the child to be born at randalls must betie there even dearer than herself and mrs  . westonheart and time would be occupied by it  . they should lose her and probably in great measure her husband also  .-- frank churchill would return among them no more and miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to highbury  . they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe  . all that were good would be withdrawn and if to these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach mr  . knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort -- no longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change his own home for their-- how was it to be endured and if he were to be lost to them for harrietsake if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in harrietsociety all that he wanted if harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing emmawretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work when it came to suchpitch as this she was not able to refrain fromstart orheavy sigh or even from walking about the room forfew seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone  . chapter xiii the weather continued much the same all the following morning and the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at hartfield -- but in the afternoon it cleared the wind changed intosofter quarter the clouds were carried off the sun appeared it was summer again  . with all the eagerness which suchtransition gives emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible  . never had the exquisite sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant afterstorm been more attractive to her  . she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce and on mr  . perrycoming in soon after dinner withdisengaged hour to give her father she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery  .-- there with spirits freshened and thoughtslittle relieved she had takenfew turns when she saw mr  . knightley passing through the garden door and coming towards her  .-- it was the first intimation of his being returned from london  . she had been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles distant  .-- there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind  . she must be collected and calm  . in halfminute they were together  . the howye dowere quiet and constrained on each side  . she asked after their mutual friends they were all well  .-- when had he left them -- only that morning  . he must have hadwet ride  .-- yes  .-- he meant to walk with her she found  . he had just looked into the dining - room and as he was not wanted there preferred being out of doors  . -- she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible cause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had been received  . they walked together  . he was silent  . she thought he was often looking at her and trying forfuller view of her face than it suited her to give  . and this belief produced another dread  . perhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet he might be watching for encouragement to begin  .-- she did not could not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject  . he must do it all himself  . yet she could not bear this silence  . with him it was most unnatural  . she considered -- resolved -- and trying to smile began -- you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you  . havesaid he quietly and looking at her of what nature oh the best nature in the world --wedding  . after waitingmoment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he replied if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchillhave heard that already  . how is it possible cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs  . goddardin his way  .hadfew lines on parish business from mr  . weston this morning and at the end of them he gave mebrief account of what had happened  . emma was quite relieved and could presently say withlittle more composure you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions  .--have not forgotten that you once tried to give mecaution  .--wishhad attended to it -- but -- withsinking voice andheavy sighseem to have been doomed to blindness  . formoment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying intone of great sensibility speaking low time my dearest emma time will heal the wound  .-- your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your fathersake --know you will not allow yourself -- . her arm was pressed again as he added inmore broken and subdued accent the feelings of the warmest friendship -- indignation -- abominable scoundrel -- and inlouder steadier tone he concluded with he will soon be gone  . they will soon be in yorkshire  .am sorry for her  . she deservesbetter fate  . emma understood him and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied you are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- andmust set you right  .--am not in want of that sort of compassion  . my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them inway thatmust always be ashamed of andwas very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures buthave no other reason to regret thatwas not in the secret earlier  . emma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed -- but checking himself -- no nounderstand you -- forgive me --am pleased that you can say even so much  .-- he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very longhope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason  .-- fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled --could neverconfess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt --could only be certain that there waspreference -- andpreference whichnever believed him to deserve  .-- he isdisgrace to the name of man  .-- and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman -- jane jane you will bemiserable creature  . mr  . knightley said emma trying to be lively but really confused --am invery extraordinary situation  .cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impressionhave as much reason to be ashamed of confessing thatnever have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural forwoman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse  .-- butnever have  . he listened in perfect silence  . she wished him to speak but he would not  . she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it washard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion  . she went on however  .have very little to say for my own conduct  .--was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased  .-- an old story probably --common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up asdo for understanding  . many circumstances assisted the temptation  . he was the son of mr  . weston -- he was continually here --always found him very pleasant -- and in short for withsigh let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered andallowed his attentions  . latterly however -- for some time indeed --have had no idea of their meaning any thing  .--thought themhabittrick nothing that called for seriousness on my side  . he has imposed on me but he has not injured me  .have never been attached to him  . and nowcan tolerably comprehend his behaviour  . he never wished to attach me  . it was merelyblind to conceal his real situation with another  .-- it was his object to blind all about him and no oneam sure could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except thatwas not blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that in shortwas somehow or other safe from him  . she had hoped for an answer here -- forfew words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far as she could judge deep in thought  . at last and tolerably in his usual tone he saidhave never hadhigh opinion of frank churchill  .--can suppose however thatmay have underrated him  . my acquaintance with him has been but trifling  .-- and even ifhave not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well  .-- with suchwoman he haschance  .--have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conductshall certainly wish him well  .have no doubt of their being happy together said emmabelieve them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached  . he ismost fortunate man returned mr  . knightley with energy  . so early in life -- at three - and - twenty --period when ifman chuseswife he generally chuses ill  . at three - and - twenty to have drawn suchprize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him -- assured of the love of suchwoman -- the disinterested love for jane fairfaxcharacter vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour -- equality of situation --mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one -- and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants  .--man would always wish to givewomanbetter home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard mustthink be the happiest of mortals  .-- frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune  . every thing turns out for his good  .-- he meets withyoung woman atwatering - place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world forperfect wife for him they could not have found her superior  .-- his aunt is in the way  .-- his aunt dies  .-- he has only to speak  .-- his friends are eager to promote his happiness  .-- he had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him  .-- he isfortunate man indeed you speak as if you envied him  . anddo envy him emma  . in one respect he is the object of my envy  . emma could say no more  . they seemed to be within halfsentence of harriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject if possible  . she made her plan she would speak of something totally different -- the children in brunswick square and she only waited for breath to begin when mr  . knightley startled her by saying you will not ask me what is the point of envy  .-- you are determinedsee to have no curiosity  .-- you are wise -- butcannot be wise  . emmamust tell you what you will not ask thoughmay wish it unsaid the next moment  . oh then donspeak it donspeak it she eagerly cried  . takelittle time consider do not commit yourself  . thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed  . emma could not bear to give him pain  . he was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her -- cost her what it would she would listen  . she might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it she might give just praise to harriet or by representing to him his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision which must be more intolerable than any alternative to suchmind as his  .-- they had reached the house  . you are going insuppose said he  . no -- replied emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke --should like to take another turn  . mr  . perry is not gone  . and after proceedingfew steps she added --stopped you ungraciously just now mr  . knightley andam afraid gave you pain  .-- but if you have any wish to speak openly to me asfriend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- asfriend indeed you may command me  .--will hear whatever you like  .will tell you exactly whatthink  . asfriend -- repeated mr  . knightley  .-- emma thatfear isword -- nohave no wish -- stay yes why shouldhesitate --have gone too far already for concealment  .-- emmaaccept your offer -- extraordinary as it may seemaccept it and refer myself to you asfriend  .-- tell me then haveno chance of ever succeeding he stopped in his earnestness to look the question and the expression of his eyes overpowered her  . my dearest emma said he for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hourconversation my dearest most beloved emma -- tell me at once  . say no if it is to be said  . -- she could really say nothing  .-- you are silent he cried with great animation absolutely silent at presentask no more  . emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment  . the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps the most prominent feeling  .cannot make speeches emma he soon resumed and intone of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing  .-- ifloved you lessmight be able to talk about it more  . but you know whatam  .-- you hear nothing but truth from me  .--have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it  .-- bear with the truthswould tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them  . the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them  . god knowshave beenvery indifferent lover  .-- but you understand me  .-- yes you see you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can  . at presentask only to hear once to hear your voice  . while he spoke emmamind was most busy and with all the wonderful velocity of thought had been able -- and yet without losingword -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole to see that harriethopes had been entirely groundlessmistakedelusion as completedelusion as any of her own -- that harriet was nothing that she was every thing herself that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all received as discouragement from herself  .-- and not only was there time for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to rejoice that harrietsecret had not escaped her and to resolve that it need not and should not  .-- it was all the service she could now render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever without vouchsafing any motive because he could not marry them both emma had it not  . she felt for harriet with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain  . she had led her friend astray and it would bereproach to her for ever but her judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobating any such alliance for him as most unequal and degrading  . her way was clear though not quite smooth  .-- she spoke then on being so entreated  .-- what did she say -- just what she ought of course  .lady always does  .-- she said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself  . he had despaired at one period he had received such an injunction to caution and silence as for the time crushed every hope -- she had begun by refusing to hear him  .-- the change had perhaps been somewhat sudden -- her proposal of taking another turn her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to might belittle extraordinary -- she felt its inconsistency but mr  . knightley was so obliging as to put up with it and seek no farther explanation  . seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is notlittle disguised orlittle mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material  .-- mr  . knightley could not impute to emmamore relenting heart than she possessed orheart more disposed to accept of his  . he had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence  . he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it  . he had come in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchillengagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her  .-- the rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings  . the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill of her havingheart completely disengaged from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain her affection himself -- but it had been no present hope -- he had only in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her  .-- the superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting  .-- the affection which he had been asking to be allowed to create if he could was already his -- within half an hour he had passed fromthoroughly distressed state of mind to something so like perfect happiness that it could bear no other name  . her change was equal  .-- this one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust  .-- on his side there had beenlong - standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of frank churchill  .-- he had been in love with emma and jealous of frank churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other  . it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country  .-- the box hill party had decided him on going away  . he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted encouraged attentions  .-- he had gone to learn to be indifferent  .-- but he had gone towrong place  . there was too much domestic happiness in his brotherhouse woman wore too amiableform in it isabella was too much like emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him for much to have been done even had his time been longer  .-- he had stayed on however vigorously day after day -- till this very morningpost had conveyed the history of jane fairfax  .-- then with the gladness which must be felt nay which he did not scruple to feel having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma was there so much fond solicitude so much keen anxiety for her that he could stay no longer  . he had ridden home through the rain and had walked up directly after dinner to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures faultless in spite of all her faults bore the discovery  . he had found her agitated and low  .-- frank churchill wasvillain  .-- he heard her declare that she had never loved him  . frank churchillcharacter was not desperate  .-- she was his own emma by hand and word when they returned into the house and if he could have thought of frank churchill then he might have deemed himvery good sort of fellow  . chapter xiv what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought out -- she had then been only daring to hope forlittle respite of suffering -- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away  . they sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected -- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun -- but never in suchstate of spirits never in any thing like it and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive daughter  . poor mr  . woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride  .-- could he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr  . perry and talked on with much self - contentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return  . as long as mr  . knightley remained with them emmafever continued but when he was gone she began to belittle tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some alloy  . her father -- and harriet  . she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question  . with respect to her father it wasquestion soon answered  . she hardly knew yet what mr  . knightley would ask butvery short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father  .-- she even wept over the idea of it assin of thought  . while he lived it must be only an engagement but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him  .-- how to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision -- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make her any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy -- on these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great -- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it  .-- she could only resolve at last that she would still avoidmeeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now fortime from highbury and -- indulging in one scheme more -- nearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick square  .-- isabella had been pleased with harriet andfew weeks spent in london must give her some amusement  .-- she did not think it in harrietnature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the children  .-- at any rate it would beproof of attention and kindness in herself from whom every thing was dueseparation for the present an averting of the evil day when they must all be together again  . she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment which left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr  . knightley in walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her inproper share of the happiness of the evening before  . he had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else whenletter was brought her from randalls --very thick letter -- she guessed what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it  .-- she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill she wanted no explanations she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote she was sure she was incapable of it  .-- it must be waded through however  . she opened the packet it was too surely so --note from mrs  . weston to herself ushered in the letter from frank to mrs  . weston  .have the greatest pleasure my dear emma in forwarding to you the enclosed  .know what thorough justice you will do it and have scarcelydoubt of its happy effect  .--think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again butwill not delay you bylong preface  .-- we are quite well  .-- this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousnesshave been feeling lately  .--did not quite like your looks on tuesday but it was an ungenial morning and though you will never own being affected by weatherthink every body feelsnorth - east wind  .--felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning but had the comfort of hearing last night by mr  . perry that it had not made him ill  . yours ever . . to mrs  . weston  . windsor - july  . my dear madam ifmade myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected but expected or notknow it will be read with candour and indulgence  .-- you are all goodness andbelieve there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct  .-- buthave been forgiven by one who had still more to resent  . my courage rises whilewrite  . it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble  .have already met with such success in two applications for pardon thatmay be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence  .-- you must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation whenfirst arrived at randalls you must consider me as havingsecret which was to be kept at all hazards  . this was the fact  . my right to place myself insituation requiring such concealment is another question  .shall not discuss it here  . for my temptation to think itrightrefer every caviller tobrick house sashed windows below and casements above in highbury  .dared not address her openly my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition andwas fortunate enough to prevail before we parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity tosecret engagement  .-- had she refusedshould have gone mad  .-- but you will be ready to say what was your hope in doing this -- what did you look forward to -- to any thing every thing -- to time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts perseverance and weariness health and sickness  . every possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence  . if you need farther explanationhave the honour my dear madam of being your husbandson and the advantage of inheritingdisposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of  .-- see me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to randalls -- and heream conscious of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid  . you will look back and see thatdid not come till miss fairfax was in highbury and as you were the person slighted you will forgive me instantly butmust work on my fathercompassion by reminding him that so long asabsented myself from his house so longlost the blessing of knowing you  . my behaviour during the very happy fortnight whichspent with you did nothope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point  . and nowcome to the principal the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation  . with the greatest respect and the warmest friendship domention miss woodhouse my father perhaps will thinkought to add with the deepest humiliation  .--few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censureacknowledge myself liable to  .-- my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicatedbelieve more than it ought  .-- in order to assistconcealment so essential to mewas led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown  .--cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object -- butam sure you will believe the declaration that hadnot been convinced of her indifferencewould not have been induced by any selfish views to go on  .-- amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me the idea ofyoung woman likely to be attached and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much my conviction as my wish  .-- she received my attentions with an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me  . we seemed to understand each other  . from our relative situation those attentions were her due and were felt to be so  .-- whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnightcannot say -- whencalled to take leave of herremember thatwas withinmoment of confessing the truth andthen fancied she was not without suspicion buthave no doubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree  .-- she may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must have penetratedpart  .cannot doubt it  . you will find whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it did not take her wholly by surprize  . she frequently gave me hints of it  .remember her telling me at the ball thatowed mrs  . elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax  .--hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss  . while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhousecould deserve nothing from either  . acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse whomregard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself  .-- whatever strange thingssaid or did during that fortnight you have nowkey to  . my heart was in highbury and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion  . if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account  .-- of the pianoforte so much talked offeel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss-- who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her  .-- the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to  . you will soonearnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself  .-- no description can describe her  . she must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word for never was therehuman creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit  .-- sincebegan this letter which will be longer thanforesawhave heard from her  .-- she givesgood account of her own health but as she never complainsdare not depend  .want to have your opinion of her looks  .know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit  . perhaps it is paid already  . let me hear from you without delayam impatient forthousand particulars  . remember how few minuteswas at randalls and in how bewildered how madstate andam not much better yet still insane either from happiness or misery  . whenthink of the kindness and favourhave met with of her excellence and patience and my unclegenerosityam mad with joy but whenrecollect all the uneasinessoccasioned her and how littledeserve to be forgivenam mad with anger  . ifcould but see her again -- butmust not propose it yet  . my uncle has been too good for me to encroach  .--must still add to this long letter  . you have not heard all that you ought to hear  .could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the 26th ult  . as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospectsshould not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose  .should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement  .-- buthad no choice  . the hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- here my dear madamwas obliged to leave off abruptly to recollect and compose myself  .--have been walking over the country and am nowhope rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be  .-- it is in factmost mortifying retrospect for me  .behaved shamefully  . and herecan admit that my manners to miss . in being unpleasant to miss . were highly blameable  . she disapproved them which ought to have been enough  .-- my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient  .-- she was displeasedthought unreasonably sothought her onthousand occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautiousthought her even cold  . but she was always right  . ifhad followed her judgment and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed propershould have escaped the greatest unhappinesshave ever known  .-- we quarrelled  .-- do you remember the morning spent at donwell -- there every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came tocrisis  .was latemet her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it  . she absolutely refused to allow me whichthen thought most unreasonable  . now howeversee nothing in it butvery natural and consistent degree of discretion  . whileto blind the world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next toproposal which might have made every previous caution useless -- had we been met walking together between donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspected  .--was mad enough however to resent  .--doubted her affection  .doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her and such apparent devotion to miss . as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment inform of words perfectly intelligible to me  .-- in short my dear madam it wasquarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine andreturned the same evening to richmond thoughmight have staid with you till the next morning merely becausewould be as angry with her as possible  . even thenwas not suchfool as not to mean to be reconciled in time butwas the injured person injured by her coldness andwent away determined that she should make the first advances  .--shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party  . had you witnessed my behaviour therecan hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again  . its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced as soon as she foundwas really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that officious mrs  . elton the whole system of whose treatment of her by the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred  .must not quarrel withspirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself but otherwiseshould loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known  .-- jane indeed -- you will observe thathave not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you  . think then whatmust have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority  . have patience with meshall soon have done  .-- she closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again  .-- she felt the engagement to besource of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it  .-- this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor auntdeath  .answered it within an hour but from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writing - desk andtrusting thathad written enough though butfew lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness  .--was rather disappointed thatdid not hear from her again speedily butmade excuses for her and was too busy and -- mayadd -- too cheerful in my views to be captious  .-- we removed to windsor and two days afterwardsreceivedparcel from her my own letters all returned -- andfew lines at the same time by the post stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last and adding that as silence on suchpoint could not be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me bysafe conveyance all my letters and requested that ifcould not directly command hers so as to send them to highbury withinweekwould forward them after that period to her at -- in short the full direction to mr  . smallridgenear bristol stared me in the face  .knew the name the placeknew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing  . it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character whichknew her to possess and the secrecy she had maintained as to any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy  . for the world would not she have seemed to threaten me  .-- imagine the shock imagine how tillhad actually detected my own blunderraved at the blunders of the post  .-- what was to be done -- one thing only  .--must speak to my uncle  . without his sanctioncould not hope to be listened to again  .--spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened away his pride and he was earlier thancould have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man withdeep sigh that he wishedmight find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done  .--felt that it would be ofdifferent sort  .-- are you disposed to pity me for whatmust have suffered in opening the cause to him for my suspense while all was at stake -- no do not pity me tillreached highbury and saw how illhad made her  . do not pity me tillsaw her wan sick looks  .--reached highbury at the time of day when from my knowledge of their late breakfast hourwas certain ofgood chance of finding her alone  .--was not disappointed and at lastwas not disappointed either in the object of my journey  .great deal of very reasonable very just displeasurehad to persuade away  . but it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no momentuneasiness can ever occur between us again  . now my dear madamwill release you butcould not conclude before  .thousand andthousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her  .-- if you think me inway to be happier thandeserveam quite of your opinion  .-- miss . calls me the child of good fortune  .hope she is right  .-- in one respect my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe myself your obliged and affectionate son . . weston churchill  . chapter xv this letter must make its way to emmafeelings  . she was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that mrs  . weston foretold  . as soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment  . she never stopt till she had gone through the whole and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to mrs  . weston and so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself that there was no being severe and could he have entered the room she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever  . she thought so well of the letter that when mr  . knightley came again she desired him to read it  . she was sure of mrs  . westonwishing it to be communicated especially to one who like mr  . knightley had seen so much to blame in his conduct  .shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long  .will take it home with me at night  . but that would not do  . mr  . weston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him  .would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seemsmatter of justice it shall be done  . he began -- stopping however almost directly to say hadbeen offered the sight of one of this gentlemanletters to his mother - in - lawfew months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference  . he proceededlittle farther reading to himself and then withsmile observed humphfine complimentary opening but it is his way  . one manstyle must not be the rule of another . we will not be severe  . it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud asread  . by doing itshall feel thatam near you  . it will not be so greatloss of time but if you dislike it -- not at all  .should wish it  . mr  . knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity  . he trifles here said he as to the temptation  . he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge  .-- bad  .-- he ought not to have formed the engagement  .-- his fatherdisposition -- he is unjust however to his father  . mr  . westonsanguine temper wasblessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr  . weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it  .-- very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here  . andhave not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would  . you pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right  .was not quite impartial in my judgment emma -- but yetthink -- had you not been in the case --should still have distrusted him  . when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her withsmilelookshake of the headword or two of assent or disapprobation or merely of love as the subject required concluding however seriously and after steady reflection thus -- very bad -- though it might have been worse  .-- playingmost dangerous game  . too much indebted to the event for his acquittal  .-- no judge of his own manners by you  .-- always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience  .-- fancying you to have fathomed his secret  . natural enough -- his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others  .-- mystery finesse -- how they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other emma agreed to it and withblush of sensibility on harrietaccount which she could not give any sincere explanation of  . you had better go on said she  . he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte ah that was the act ofvery very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure  .boyish scheme indeed --cannot comprehendmanwishing to givewoman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrumentcoming if she could  . after this he made some progress without any pause  . frank churchillconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more thanword in passing  .perfectly agree with you sir -- was then his remark  . you did behave very shamefully  . you never wrotetruer line  . and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfaxsense of right he madefuller pause to say this is very bad  .-- he had induced her to place herself for his sake insituation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily  .-- she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could  . he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable  . we must look to her one fault and remember that she had donewrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in suchstate of punishment  . emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party and grew uncomfortable  . her own behaviour had been so very improper she was deeply ashamed andlittle afraid of his next look  . it was all read however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist  . there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons was his next observation  .-- his feelings are natural  .-- what actually resolve to break with him entirely -- she felt the engagement to besource of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it  .-- whatview this gives of her sense of his behaviour -- well he must bemost extraordinary -- nay nay read on  .-- you will find how very much he suffers  .hope he does replied mr  . knightley coolly and resuming the letter  . smallridge -- what does this mean what is all this she had engaged to go as governess to mrs  . smallridgechildren --dear friend of mrs  . elton--neighbour of maple grove and by the byewonder how mrs  . elton bears the disappointment say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read -- not even of mrs  . elton  . only one page more  .shall soon have done  . whatletter the man writeswish you would read it withkinder spirit towards him  . well there is feeling here  .-- he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill  .-- certainlycan have no doubt of his being fond of her  . dearer much dearer than ever  .hope he may long continue to feel all the value of suchreconciliation  .-- he isvery liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands  .-- happier thandeserve  . come he knows himself there  . miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune  . -- those were miss woodhousewords were they -- andfine ending -- and there is the letter  . the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter asam but still you must at leasthope you must think the better of him for it  .hope it does him some service with you  . yes certainly it does  . he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness andam very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyonddoubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with heram very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants  . and now let me talk to you of something else  .have another personinterest at present so much at heart thatcannot think any longer about frank churchill  . ever sinceleft you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject  . the subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english such as mr  . knightley used even to the woman he was in love with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the happiness of her father  . emmaanswer was ready at the first word  . while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her  . she could never quit him  . part only of this answer however was admitted  . the impossibility of her quitting her father mr  . knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to  . he had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce mr  . woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr  . woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that suchtransplantation would berisk of her fathercomfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded  . mr  . woodhouse taken from hartfield -- no he felt that it ought not to be attempted  . but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as her fatherhappiness in other words his life -- required hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise  . of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own passing thoughts  . like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her  . she was sensible of all the affection it evinced  . she felt that in quitting donwell he must be sacrificinggreat deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with  . she promised to think of it and advised him to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject  . he had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning to have his thoughts to himself  . ah there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma  .am sure william larkins will not like it  . you must get his consent before you ask mine  . she promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of finding itvery good scheme  . it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded  . think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy and yet she only gave herselfsaucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr  . knightleymarrying jane fairfax or any body else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt  . this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield -- the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became  . his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual good to outweigh every drawback  . suchcompanion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her -- suchpartner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy she would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield  . the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself poor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept atdistance from  . she would beloser in every way  . emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment  . in suchparty harriet would be ratherdead weight than otherwise but for the poor girl herself it seemedpeculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in suchstate of unmerited punishment  . in time of course mr  . knightley would be forgotten that is supplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early  . mr  . knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure -- not like mr  . elton  . mr  . knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she could be in love with more than three men in one year  . chapter xvi it wasvery great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoidmeeting  . their intercourse was painful enough by letter  . how much worse had they been obliged to meet harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of ill - usage and yet emma fancied there wassomething of resentmentsomething bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate  .-- it might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under suchstroke  . she had no difficulty in procuring isabellainvitation and she was fortunate in havingsufficient reason for asking it without resorting to invention  .-- there wastooth amiss  . harriet really wished and had wished some time to consultdentist  . mrs  . john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill health wasrecommendation to her -- and though not so fond ofdentist as ofmr  . wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet under her care  .-- when it was thus settled on her sisterside emma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable  .-- harriet was to go she was invited for at leastfortnight she was to be conveyed in mr  . woodhousecarriage  .-- it was all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square  . now emma could indeed enjoy mr  . knightleyvisits now she could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her when remembering how disappointedheart was near her how much might at that moment and atlittle distance be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself  . the difference of harriet at mrs  . goddardor in london made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emmasensations but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself  . she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied  . there wascommunication before her one which she only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father but she would have nothing to do with it at present  .-- she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs  . weston were safe and well  . no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time  .--fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers  . she soon resolved equally asduty andpleasure to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax  .-- she ought to go -- and she was longing to see her the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill  . it would besecret satisfaction but the consciousness ofsimilarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate  . she went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected  .-- the fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name  .-- she heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible  .-- no she heard nothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk up -- andmoment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient  .-- emma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging  . there was consciousness animation and warmth there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted  .-- she came forward with an offered hand and said inlow but very feeling tone this is most kind indeed -- miss woodhouse it is impossible for me to express --hope you will believe -- excuse me for being so entirely without words  . emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the sound of mrs  . eltonvoice from the sitting - room had not checked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations intovery very earnest shake of the hand  . mrs  . bates and mrs  . elton were together  . miss bates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity  . emma could have wished mrs  . elton elsewhere but she was inhumour to have patience with every body and as mrs  . elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm  . she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs  . eltonthoughts and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits it was being in miss fairfaxconfidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was stillsecret to other people  . emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face and while paying her own compliments to mrs  . bates and appearing to attend to the good old ladyreplies she saw her withsort of anxious parade of mystery fold upletter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods we can finish this some other time you know  . you andshall not want opportunities  . and in fact you have heard all the essential already  .only wanted to prove to you that mrs  . . admits our apology and is not offended  . you see how delightfully she writes  . oh she issweet creature you would have doated on her had you gone  .-- but notword more  . let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour  .-- hush -- you remember those lines --forget the poem at this moment for whenladyin the case you know all other things give place  . nowsay my dear in our case for lady read ---- mumword to the wise  .--am infine flow of spirits ani butwant to set your heart at ease as to mrs  . .-- my representation you see has quite appeased her  . and again on emmamerely turning her head to look at mrs  . batesknitting she added inhalf whispermentioned no names you will observe  .-- oh no cautious asminister of state  .managed it extremely well  . emma could not doubt  . it waspalpable display repeated on every possible occasion  . when they had all talkedlittle while in harmony of the weather and mrs  . weston she found herself abruptly addressed with do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered -- do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit -- here wasside - glance of great meaning at jane  . upon my word perry has restored her inwonderful short time -- oh if you had seen her asdid when she was at the worst -- and when mrs  . bates was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not sayword of any assistance that perry might have notword ofcertain young physician from windsor  .-- oh no perry shall have all the credit  .have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill  . very pleasant party  . but yetthink there was something wanting  . things did not seem -- that is there seemedlittle cloud upon the spirits of some  .-- so it appeared to me at least butmight be mistaken  . howeverthink it answered so far as to tempt one to go again  . what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts -- it must be the same party you know quite the same party not one exception  . soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing  . thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness  .-- it is impossible to say -- yes indeedquite understand -- dearest janeprospects -- that isdo not mean  .-- but she is charmingly recovered  .-- how is mr  . woodhouse --am so glad  .-- quite out of my power  .-- suchhappy little circle as you find us here  .-- yes indeed  .-- charming young man -- that is -- so very friendlymean good mr  . perry -- such attention to jane -- and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs  . elton for being there emma guessed that there had beenlittle show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome  .-- afterfew whispers indeed which placed it beyondguess mrs  . elton speaking louder said yes heream my good friend and herehave been so long that anywhere elseshould think it necessary to apologise but the truth is thatam waiting for my lord and master  . he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you  . what are we to have the pleasure ofcall from mr  . elton -- that will befavour indeed forknow gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr  . eltontime is so engaged  . upon my word it is miss bates  .-- he really is engaged from morning to night  .-- there is no end of peoplecoming to him on some pretence or other  .-- the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion  . they seem not able to do any thing without him  .-- upon my word mr  . .often say rather you than .--do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument ifhad half so many applicants  . -- bad enough as it is forabsolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree  .--believehave not playedbar this fortnight  .-- however he is comingassure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all  . and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma --congratulatory visit you know  .-- oh yes quite indispensable  . miss bates looked about her so happily -- he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation  .-- mr  . . is knightleyright hand  . emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is mr  . elton gone on foot to donwell -- he will havehot walk  . oh no it ismeeting at the crownregular meeting  . weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who lead  .--fancy mr  . . and knightley have every thing their own way  . have not you mistaken the day said emma  .am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to - morrow  .-- mr  . knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday  . oh no the meeting is certainly to - day was the abrupt answer which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs  . eltonside  .--do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever was  . we never heard of such things at maple grove  . your parish there was small said jane  . upon my word my deardo not know fornever heard the subject talked of  . but it is proved by the smallness of the school whichhave heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs  . bragge the only school and not more than five - and - twenty children  . ah you clever creature thatvery true  . whatthinking brain you havesay jane whatperfect character you andshould make if we could be shaken together  . my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection  .-- not thatpresume to insinuate however that some people may not think you perfection already  .-- but hush -- notword if you please  . it seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words not to mrs  . elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw  . the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very evident though it could not often proceed beyondlook  . mr  . elton made his appearance  . his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity  . very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come -- but you knew whatdutiful creature you had to deal with  . you knewshould not stir till my lord and master appeared  .-- here havebeen sitting this hour giving these young ladiessample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted mr  . elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away  . his civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing  . whengot to donwell said he knightley could not be found  . very odd very unaccountable after the notesent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one  . donwell cried his wife  .-- my dear mr  . . you have not been to donwell -- you mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown  . no no thatto - morrow andparticularly wanted to see knightley to - day on that very account  .-- suchdreadful broiling morning --went over the fields too -- speaking intone of great ill - usage which made it so much the worse  . and then not to find him at homeassure youam not at all pleased  . and no apology left no message for me  . the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected  .-- very extraordinary -- and nobody knew at all which way he was gone  . perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods  .-- miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley -- can you explain it emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had notsyllable to say for him  .cannot imagine said mrs  . elton feeling the indignity aswife ought to docannot imagine how he could do suchthing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten -- my dear mr  . . he must have leftmessage for youam sure he must  .-- not even knightley could be so very eccentric -- and his servants forgot it  . depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are allhave often observed extremely awkward and remiss  .--am surewould not have suchcreature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration  . and as for mrs  . hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed  .-- she promised wrightreceipt and never sent it  .met william larkins continued mr  . elton asgot near the house and he told meshould not find his master at home butdid not believe him  .-- william seemed rather out of humour  . he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him  .have nothing to do with williamwants but it really is of very great importance thatshould see knightley to - day and it becomesmatter therefore of very serious inconvenience thatshould have had this hot walk to no purpose  . emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly  . in all probability she was at this very time waited for there and mr  . knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr  . elton if not towards william larkins  . she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say it is as well perhaps thathave not had the possibility  . had you not been surrounded by other friendsmight have been tempted to introducesubject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct  .--feel thatshould certainly have been impertinent  . oh cried jane withblush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure -- there would have been no danger  . the danger would have been of my wearying you  . you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest -- . indeed miss woodhouse speaking more collectedly with the consciousness whichhave of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to suchdegree as to --have not time for half thatcould wish to say  .long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself  .feel it so very due  . but unfortunately -- in short if your compassion does not stand my friend -- oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and taking her hand  . you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even -- you are very kind butknow what my manners were to you  .-- so cold and artificial --had alwayspart to act  .-- it waslife of deceit --know thatmust have disgusted you  . pray say no more  .feel that all the apologies should be on my side  . let us forgive each other at once  . we must do whatever is to be done quickest andthink our feelings will lose no time there  .hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor very  . and the next newssuppose will be that we are to lose you -- just asbegin to know you  . oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet  .am here till claimed by colonel and mrs  . campbell  . nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma smiling -- but excuse me it must be thought of  . the smile was returned as jane answered you are very right it has been thought of  . andwill own to youam sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr  . churchill at enscombe it is settled  . there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are overimagine there will be nothing more to wait for  . thank you thank you  .-- this is just whatwanted to be assured of  .-- oh if you knew how muchlove every thing that is decided and open -- good - bye good - bye  . chapter xvii mrs  . westonfriends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother oflittle girl  . she had been decided in wishing formiss weston  . she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of makingmatch for her hereafter with either of isabellasons but she was convinced thatdaughter would suit both father and mother best  . it would begreat comfort to mr  . weston as he grew older -- and even mr  . weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies ofchild never banished from home and mrs  . weston -- no one could doubt thatdaughter would be most to her and it would be quitepity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again  . she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continued -- like la baronnealmane on la comtesseostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated onmore perfect plan  . that is replied mr  . knightley she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all  . it will be the only difference  . poor child cried emma at that rate what will become of her nothing very bad  .-- the fate of thousands  . she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older  .am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma  .who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them emma laughed and replied buthad the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people  .doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it  . do you --have no doubt  . nature gave you understanding -- miss taylor gave you principles  . you must have done well  . my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good  . it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me -- andam afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done indisagreeable manner  .do not believedid you any good  . the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me  .could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least  .am sure you were of use to me cried emma  .was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener thanwould own at the time  .am very sure you did me good  . and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen  . how often when you weregirl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks -- mr  . knightleyam going to do so - and - so papa saysmay orhave miss taylorleave -- something which you knewdid not approve  . in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one  . what an amiable creaturewas -- no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance  . mr  . knightley  . -- you always called me mr  . knightley and from habit it has not so very formalsound  .-- and yet it is formal  .want you to call me something else butdo not know what  .remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago  .did it becausethought it would offend you but as you made no objectionnever did it again  . and cannot you call me george now impossible --never can call you any thing but mr  . knightley  .will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs  . elton by calling you mr  . .-- butwill promise she added presently laughing and blushing --will promise to call you once by your christian name  .do not say when but perhaps you may guess where -- in the building in which . takes . for better for worse  . emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with harriet smith but it was too tendersubject  .-- she could not enter on it  .-- harriet was very seldom mentioned between them  . this on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy andsuspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining  . she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on isabellaletters  . he might observe that it was so  . the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy  . isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which appeared perfectly natural as there wasdentist to be consulted but since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before  .-- isabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have escaped her  . emmacomforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by harrietbeing to stay longer her fortnight was likely to bemonth at least  . mr  . and mrs  . john knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back  . john does not even mention your friend said mr  . knightley  . here is his answer if you like to see it  . it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage  . emma accepted it withvery eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned  . john enters likebrother into my happiness continued mr  . knightley but he is no complimenter and thoughwell know him to have likewisemost brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise  . butam not afraid of your seeing what he writes  . he writes likesensible man replied emma when she had read the letter  .honour his sincerity  . it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already  . had he said any thing to beardifferent constructionshould not have believed him  . my emma he means no such thing  . he only means -- he andshould differ very little in our estimation of the two interrupted she withsort of serious smile -- much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject  . emma my dear emma -- oh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion  . depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice  . he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine  .wishmay not sink into poor emma with him at once  .-- his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther  . ah he criedwish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together  .am amused by one part of johnletter -- did you notice it -- where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind  . ifunderstand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying  . he had no idea of me  . he seems perfectly unprepared for that  . yes yes -- butam amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings  . what has he been judging by --am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another  .-- but it was sosuppose  .dare say there wasdifference whenwas staying with them the other day  .believedid not play with the children quite so much as usual  .remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now  . the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons reception of it tried  . as soon as mrs  . weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr  . woodhousevisits emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls  .-- but how to break it to her father at last -- she had bound herself to do it in such an hour of mr  . knightleyabsence or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must have put it off but mr  . knightley was to come at suchtime and follow up the beginning she was to make  .-- she was forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too  . she must not make itmore decided subject of misery to him bymelancholy tone herself  . she must not appear to think itmisfortune  .-- with all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then infew words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it wasplan to promote the happiness of all -- she and mr  . knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that personcompany whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs  . weston best in the world  . poor man -- it was at firstconsiderable shock to him and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it  . she was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would begreat deal better for her to remain single and told of poor isabella and poor miss taylor  .-- but it would not do  . emma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs  . weston whose marriages taking them from hartfield had indeed mademelancholy change but she was not going from hartfield she should be always there she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better and she was very sure that he would begreat deal the happier for having mr  . knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea  .-- did he not love mr  . knightley very much -- he would not deny that he did she was sure  .-- whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr  . knightley -- who was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him -- who so cheerful so attentive so attached to him -- would not he like to have him always on the spot -- yes  . that was all very true  . mr  . knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see him every day -- but they did see him every day as it was  .-- why could not they go on as they had done mr  . woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome the idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest  .-- to emmaentreaties and assurances succeeded mr  . knightleywhose fond praise of her gave the subject evenkind of welcome and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion  .-- they had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest approbation and mrs  . weston was ready on the first meeting to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first assettled and secondly asgood one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr  . woodhousemind  .-- it was agreed upon as what was to be and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place  . mrs  . weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event  .-- she had been extremely surprized never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost  .-- she had suchregard for mr  . knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionableconnexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it long ago  .-- how very few of those men inrank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield and who but mr  . knightley could know and bear with mr  . woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable -- the difficulty of disposing of poor mr  . woodhouse had been always felt in her husbandplans and her own formarriage between frank and emma  . how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had beencontinual impediment -- less acknowledged by mr  . weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying -- those matters will take care of themselves the young people will findway  . but here there was nothing to be shifted off inwild speculation on the future  . it was all right all open all equal  . no sacrifice on any side worth the name  . it wasunion of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it  . mrs  . weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections as these was one of the happiest women in the world  . if any thing could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps  . the news was universallysurprize wherever it spread and mr  . weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind  .-- he saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it  . it is to besecretconclude said he  . these matters are alwayssecret till it is found out that every body knows them  . only let me be told whenmay speak out  .--wonder whether jane has any suspicion  . he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that point  . he told her the news  . was not she likedaughter his eldest daughter -- he must tell her and miss bates being present it passed of course to mrs  . cole mrs  . perry and mrs  . elton immediately afterwards  . it was no more than the principals were prepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking of themselves as the evening wonder in manyfamily circle with great sagacity  . in general it wasvery well approved match  . some might think him and others might think her the most in luck  . one set might recommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation the vicarage  .-- there the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction  . mr  . elton cared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the young ladypride would now be contented and supposed she had always meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point of living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than-- but mrs  . elton was very much discomposed indeed  .-- poor knightley poor fellow -- sad business for him  .-- she was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he hadthousand good qualities  .-- how could he be so taken in -- did not think him at all in love -- not in the least  .-- poor knightley -- there would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him  .-- how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him but that would be all over now  .-- poor fellow -- no more exploring parties to donwell made for her  . oh no there would bemrs  . knightley to throw cold water on every thing  .-- extremely disagreeable but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day  .-- shocking plan living together  . it would never do  . she knewfamily near maple grove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter  . chapter xviii time passed on  .few more to - morrows and the party from london would be arriving  . it was an alarming change and emma was thinking of it one morning as what must bringgreat deal to agitate and grieve her when mr  . knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by  . after the first chat of pleasure he was silent and then ingraver tone began withhave something to tell you emma some news  . good or bad said she quickly looking up in his face  .do not know which it ought to be called  . oh goodam sure  .--see it in your countenance  . you are trying not to smile  .am afraid said he composing his featuresam very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it  . indeed but why so --can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too  . there is one subject he repliedhope but one on which we do not think alike  . he pausedmoment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face  . does nothing occur to you -- do not you recollect -- harriet smith  . her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what  . have you heard from her yourself this morning cried he  . you havebelieve and know the whole  . nohave notknow nothing pray tell me  . you are prepared for the worstsee -- and very bad it is  . harriet smith marries robert martin  . emma gavestart which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible but her lips were closed  . it is so indeed continued mr  . knightleyhave it from robert martin himself  . he left me not half an hour ago  . she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement  . you like it my emma as little asfeared  .--wish our opinions were the same  . but in time they will  . time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject  . you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself  . it is not that suchcircumstance would now make me unhappy butcannot believe it  . it seems an impossibility -- you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin  . you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet  . you only mean that he intends it  .mean that he has done it answered mr  . knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted  . good god she cried  .-- well -- then having recourse to her workbasket in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing she added well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me  . how where when -- let me know it all  .never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappyassure you  .-- how -- how has it been possible it isvery simple story  . he went to town on business three days ago andgot him to take charge of some papers whichwas wanting to send to john  .-- he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley . they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley . the party was to be our brother and sister henry john -- and miss smith  . my friend robert could not resist  . they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit asunderstand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain  .-- she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving  . he came down by yesterdaycoach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own  . this is all thatcan relate of the how where and when  . your friend harriet will makemuch longer history when you see her  .-- she will give you all the minute particulars which only womanlanguage can make interesting  .-- in our communications we deal only in the great  .-- howevermust say that robert martinheart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astleymy brother took charge of mrs  . john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in suchcrowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy  . he stopped  .-- emma dared not attempt any immediate reply  . to speak she was sure would be to betraymost unreasonable degree of happiness  . she must waitmoment or he would think her mad  . her silence disturbed him and after observing herlittle while he added emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy butam afraid it gives you more pain than you expected  . his situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend andwill answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more  . his good sense and good principles would delight you  .-- as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands  . his rank in societywould alter ifcould which is sayinggreat dealassure you emma  .-- you laugh at me about william larkins butcould quite as ill spare robert martin  . he wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match  .think harriet is doing extremely well  . her connexions may be worse than his  . in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are  .have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize  . you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unpreparedwas -- forhad reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before  . you ought to know your friend best replied mr  . knightley butshould say she wasgood - tempered soft - hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her  . emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my wordbelieve you know her quite as well asdo  .-- but mr  . knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him  .could suppose she might in time -- but can she already -- did not you misunderstand him -- you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills -- and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him -- it was not harriethand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox  . the contrast between the countenance and air of mr  . knightley and robert martin was at this moment so strong to emmafeelings and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harrietside so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis nohopeknow better than to think of robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature  . it could not be otherwise  . do you dare say this cried mr  . knightley  . do you dare to suppose me so greatblockhead as not to know whatman is talking of -- what do you deserve ohalways deserve the best treatment becausenever put up with any other and therefore you must give meplain direct answer  . are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr  . martin and harriet now aream quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used andthinkcan give youproof that it must be so  . he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do  . he knew of no one but mrs  . goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends  . couldmention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs  . goddardassured him thatcould not  . then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day  .am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles and most sincerely wish them happy  . you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before  .hope so -- for at that timewasfool  . andam changed also foram now very willing to grant you all harrietgood qualities  .have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martinsake whomhave always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her  .have often talked to hergood deal  . you must have seen thatdid  . sometimes indeedhave thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martincause which was never the case but from all my observationsam convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life  .-- much of thishave no doubt she may thank you for  . me cried emma shaking her head  .-- ah poor harriet she checked herself however and submitted quietly tolittle more praise than she deserved  . their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father  . she was not sorry  . she wanted to be alone  . her mind was instate of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected  . she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits and till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she could be fit for nothing rational  . her fatherbusiness was to announce jamesbeing gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing  . the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined  . the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harrietwelfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security  .-- what had she to wish for nothing but to grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own  . nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future  . serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions and yet there was no preventinglaugh sometimes in the very midst of them  . she must laugh at suchclose such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back suchheart -- suchharriet now there would be pleasure in her returning -- every thing would bepleasure  . it would begreat pleasure to know robert martin  . high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr  . knightley would soon be over  . the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over  . she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome asduty  . in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father not always listening but always agreeing to what he said and whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor mrs  . weston would be disappointed  . they arrived  .-- mrs  . weston was alone in the drawing - room -- but hardly had they been told of the baby and mr  . woodhouse received the thanks for coming which he asked for whenglimpse was caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window  . it is frank and miss fairfax said mrs  . weston  .was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning  . he stays till to - morrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us  .-- they are coming inhope  . in halfminute they were in the room  . emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there wasdegree of confusion --number of embarrassing recollections on each side  . they met readily and smiling but withconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time suchblank in the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure  . when mr  . weston joined the party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longerwant of subject or animation -- or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and sayhave to thank you miss woodhouse forvery kind forgiving message in one of mrs  . westonletters  .hope time has not made you less willing to pardon  .hope you do not retract what you then said  . no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least  .am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person  . he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness  . is not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane  . better than she ever used to do -- you see how my father and mrs  . weston doat upon her  . but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of dixon  .-- emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing  .can never think of it she cried without extreme shame  . the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be  . but is it possible that you had no suspicion --mean of late  . earlyknow you had none  .never had the smallestassure you  . that appears quite wonderful  .was once very near -- andwishhad -- it would have been better  . but thoughwas always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service  .-- it would have beenmuch better transgression hadbroken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing  . it is not now worthregret said emma  .have some hope resumed he of my unclebeing persuaded to payvisit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her  . when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue theretrust till we may carry her northward  .-- but nowam at suchdistance from her -- is not it hard miss woodhouse -- till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation  . do not you pity me emma spoke her pity so very kindly that withsudden accession of gay thought he cried ah by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the moment --hope mr  . knightley is well he paused  .-- she coloured and laughed  .--know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour  . let me return your congratulations  .--assure you thathave heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction  .-- he isman whomcannot presume to praise  . emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane and his next words were did you ever see suchskin -- such smoothness such delicacy -- and yet without being actually fair  .-- one cannot call her fair  . it ismost uncommon complexion with her dark eye - lashes and hair --most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it  .-- just colour enough for beauty  .have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do notremember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale -- when we first began to talk of her  .-- have you quite forgotten oh no -- what an impudent dogwas -- how coulddare -- but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help sayingdo suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all  .--am sure you had  .--am sure it wasconsolation to you  . oh no no no -- how can you suspect me of suchthingwas the most miserable wretch not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth  .am sure it wassource of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in  .-- perhapsam the readier to suspect because to tell you the truththink it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation  .think there islittle likeness between us  . he bowed  . if not in our dispositions she presently added withlook of true sensibility there islikeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own  . true true he answered warmly  . no not true on your side  . you can have no superior but most true on mine  .-- she iscomplete angel  . look at her  . is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat  . observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father  .-- you will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my auntjewels  . they are to be new set  .am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head  . will not it be beautiful in her dark hair very beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out how delightedam to see you again and to see you in such excellent looks --would not have missed this meeting for the world  .should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come  . the others had been talking of the child mrs  . weston giving an account oflittle alarm she had been under the evening before from the infantappearing not quite well  . she believed she had been foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within halfminute of sending for mr  . perry  . perhaps she ought to be ashamed but mr  . weston had been almost as uneasy as herself  .-- in ten minutes however the child had been perfectly well again  . this was her history and particularly interesting it was to mr  . woodhouse who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done it  . she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered were it only formoment  . she could not be too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often  . it waspity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had seen it  . frank churchill caught the name  . perry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss fairfaxeye  . my friend mr  . perry what are they saying about mr  . perry -- has he been here this morning -- and how does he travel now -- has he set up his carriage emma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined in the laugh it was evident from janecountenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf  . such an extraordinary dream of mine he cried  .can never think of it without laughing  .-- she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse  .see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown  . look at her  . do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others jane was forced to smile completely formoment and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said inconscious low yet steady voice how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me -- they will sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them he hadgreat deal to say in return and very entertainingly but emmafeelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on leaving randalls and falling naturally intocomparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of mr  . knightleyhigh superiority of character  . the happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced  . chapter xix if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harrietmomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr  . knightley and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty  .very few days brought the party from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was -- that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr  . knightley and was now forming all her views of happiness  . harriet waslittle distressed -- did looklittle foolish at first but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and self - deceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her withoutcare for the past and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to her friendapprobation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations  .-- harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astleyand the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight  . but what did such particulars explain -- the fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible  .-- beyond this it must ever be unintelligible to emma  . the event however was most joyful and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so  .-- harrietparentage became known  . she proved to be the daughter oftradesman rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to have always wished for concealment  .-- such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for -- it was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of manygentleman but whatconnexion had she been preparing for mr  . knightley -- or for the churchills -- or even for mr  . elton -- the stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth would have beenstain indeed  . no objection was raised on the fatherside the young man was treated liberally it was all as it should be and as emma became acquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend  . she had no doubt of harriethappiness with any good - tempered man but with him and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and improvement  . she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness  . she would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out  . she would be respectable and happy and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in suchman -- or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself  . harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins was less and less at hartfield which was not to be regretted  .-- the intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must change intocalmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner  . before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so completesatisfaction as no remembrances even connected with mr  . elton as he stood before them could impair  .-- perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw mr  . elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself  .-- robert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married  . jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells  .-- the mr  . churchills were also in town and they were only waiting for november  . the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by emma and mr  . knightley  .-- they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to allow them the fortnightabsence intour to the seaside which was the plan  .-- john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in approving it  . but mr  . woodhouse -- how was mr  . woodhouse to be induced to consent -- he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but asdistant event  . when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were almost hopeless  .--second allusion indeed gave less pain  .-- he began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent it --very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation  . still however he was not happy  . nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughtercourage failed  . she could not bear to see him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr  . knightleys that when once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she hesitated -- she could not proceed  . in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden illumination of mr  . woodhousemind or any wonderful change of his nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another way  .-- mrs  . westonpoultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys -- evidently by the ingenuity of man  . other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered  .-- pilfering was housebreaking to mr  . woodhousefears  .-- he was very uneasy and but for the sense of his son - in - lawprotection would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life  . the strength resolution and presence of mind of the mr  . knightleys commanded his fullest dependence  . while either of them protected him and his hartfield was safe  .-- but mr  . john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november  . the result of this distress was that withmuch more voluntary cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and mr  . elton was called on withinmonth from the marriage of mr  . and mrs  . robert martin to join the hands of mr  . knightley and miss woodhouse  . the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have no taste for finery or parade and mrs  . elton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very inferior to her own  .-- very little white satin very few lace veilsmost pitiful business -- selina would stare when she heard of it  . -- but in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union  . finis\n"
